SENTENCES
"lack of linguistic clarity and specificity within the educational literature (e.g., Alexander et al.1991 ,2008 ; Murphy and Alexander 2000 ), where even our most central concepts and constructs, such as knowledge, learning, or motivation, are used with either the expectationthat their meanings are well known and well accepted or without regard for the thoughtsthat engendered them or the thoughts that might ensue from their imprecise usage"
"Of late, this concern about the clarity of meaning has become evident to us with regard to three often used and seemingly related terms, metacognition ,self-regulation , and self- regulated learning "
The triggering event in our exploration of these three terms was the emergent interest of the first and third authors in engaging in empirical research thatinvolves individuals ’monitoring and regulation of their learning and the concomitant inability to articulate sufficiently the conceptual boundaries between these three oftenentangled bodies of literature
"In effect, the more we read, the more researchers ’language left us confused"
"Further, it seemed from our cursory look into the literature that the risingpopularity of self-regulation and self-regulated learning and the reemerging interest inmetacognition added to the dilemma we were facing"
"Therefore, we chose to look deeperinto the literatures on metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning; to focus our lens on these bodies of work in an attempt to sharpen the images presented and to bring a greater definition to the constructs alone and in association"
We consider the disentanglingof these terms as an important step to advance our programs of research on learnermonitoring and regulation and those of others
"Due to the scope and complexity of this review, it is critical to establish its goals and parameters"
"Specifically, our focus is the core meaning of metacognition ,self-regulation , andself-regulated learning , as well as where these constructs converge and diverge along select dimensions"
"The review is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustiveexamination of each individual construct, as excellent reviews in these areas have beenundertaken by others for metacognition (e.g., Schwartz and Metcalfe 1994 ), self-regulation (e.g., Wigfield 1994 ), and self-regulated learning (e.g., Boekaerts and Cascallar 2006 )"
"Instead, we seek to extract the salient attributes of these constructs from the literature and to consider their potentially overlapping boundaries"
"Further, from our analysis, we wantedto identify significant issues affecting the definition and use of these constructs"
"Toaccomplish these two goals, it was essential for us to attend not just to the recent research inthese areas, but to the theoretical and empirical roots of each"
"By tracing back to theempirical beginnings of metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning, we feltwe could better understand how and why the conceptualization and operationalization ofthese terms evolved into their present-day manifestations"
Conceptual Roots and Conceptual Frames Metacognition and self-regulation have unique roots within the psychological literature that must briefly be traced in order to contextualize the subsequent empirical analysis
"This briefframing is complemented by Fox and Riconscente ’s(2008 ) in-depth and more philosophical survey of the writings of William James, Lev Vygotsky, and Jean Piagetthat are foundational to the earlier psychological works we discuss"
"MetacognitionMetacognitive monitoring emerged as a construct in the 1970s, stemming from writings on metaprocesses such as metamemory (e.g., Flavell 1971 )"
In John Flavell ’s seminal writings392 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409
"on metacognitive monitoring, he set the stage for this construct by describing the developmental aspects of how one monitors or thinks about one ’s own cognition"
"Flavell forwarded the conceptual definition of metacognition as “thinking about thinking ”(e.g., Miller et al"
"He went on to operationalize metacognition into four key areas: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, goals, and the activation of strategies"
"According to Flavell, the developmental process by which a person ’s metacognitive skills begin to grow or decline happens via the interaction of these four components, particularlymetacognitive experiences"
"At a broader level, the foundation of metacognition is in themind of the individual"
Metacognition has been positioned in what Moshman ( 1982 ) labeled endogenous constructivism 
"That is, metacognition deals primarily with reflective abstraction of new or existing cognitive structures"
"Although the contemporary foundations for metacognition were laid by Flavell, he is not the only contributor to its conceptualization"
"For instance, Baker and Brown ( 1984 ), separated metacognition into two distinct elements: knowledge about cognition (monitor-ing) and self-regulatory mechanisms that contain monitoring as a central focus"
"The self- regulatory mechanisms included checking the outcome, planning, monitoring effectiveness, testing, revising, and evaluating strategies (Baker and Brown 1984 )"
"The focus on strategic control processes was further developed into what some have called meta- cognitive control processes (e.g., Nelson et al"
"With the incorporation of self- regulatory metacognitive mechanisms, we begin to see some confound with the constructof self-regulation, as metacognition began to gradually diverge and expand from Flavell ’s original conceptualization"
Self-regulation (SR) and self-regulated learning (SRL)Contemporary self-regulation has been heavily influenced by the work of one scholar whose initial writings were published in the 1970s
Albert Bandura ’s(1986 )Social Foundations of Thought and Action helped to shape the direction and development of self-regulation
"Compared to the clearly cognitive orientation in metacognition, self-regulation initiallyemphasized behavioral and emotional regulation (e.g., Bandura 1982 ,1989 )"
"With Bandura ’s later writings on self-efficacy, motivation emerged as an additional regulatory area"
"Further, Bandura ( 1977 ) described human functioning as the interaction between person, behavior, and environment"
"Specifically, self-regulation emphasizes the reciprocal deter-minism of the environment on the person, mediated through behavior"
Person variablesinclude the distinct selfprocesses that interact with the environment through one ’s actions
"For example, Bandura ’s self-reinforcement processes in Social Learning Theory (SLT) are predominately motivational"
"These motivational dimensions include evaluative dimensions of performance, personal standards, valuations of activities, and attributions"
"However, the act of self-regulation does not occur without the interaction of the person with theenvironment"
"Although these contextual factors may play a smaller role than the personprocesses, these interactions are critical to the self-regulation process"
"This theoretical focusappears different than with metacognition, involving a type of exogenous constructivism (Moshman 1982 )"
"Specifically, in SLT, the emphasis is placed on the derivation of knowledge from the environment"
"Moreover, while Flavell and metacognition researchersappear to have been more influenced by the cognitive orientation of his predecessors (e.g.,Jean Piaget), Bandura and other self-regulation researchers appear to have been moreinfluenced by neobehaviorism (e.g., the writings of Kenneth Spence), which takes its cuesfrom more empiricist frameworks (Byrnes 1992 ).Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 393"
"Since the publication of Bandura ’s classic volume, self-regulation has continued to develop"
"For instance, of particular interest to this review is the emergence of SR researchin academic domains by Zimmerman, Schunk, and colleagues (e.g., Zimmerman andSchunk 2001 )"
1991 ) have provided a finer-grained analysis of self-regulation in their examination of SR strategies in academic domains such as writing
"The increased focus on self-regulation in academic settings appears to have directly contributed to the emergence of a new term, self-regulated learning or SRL"
"SRL emerged in the 1980s and gained prominence in the 1990s, just as the work on hypermedia wasbecoming a growing presence in the educational literature"
The developmental path of SRLis quite different from the trajectories of metacognition and self-regulation
"Specifically,while metacognition and SR developed in parallel with little observable cross-fertilization,most models of SRL incorporate aspects of both metacognition and self-regulation to shapeits lens on learner monitoring"
"Theorists initially posited SRL as an integrated theory oflearning (Corno and Mandinach 1983 ), deliberately attempting to address the interaction of cognitive, motivational, and contextual factors rather than their isolated contributions"
"Unlike the beginnings of metacognition and self-regulation, the regulatory focus was relatively broad"
The broader regulatory focus in SRL integrates both endogenous andexogenous theories into one that Moshman ( 1982 ) described as dialectical constructivism 
"In SRL, “neither exogenous learning nor endogenous development is, in this view, predominant over theother: The two exist in a relation of reciprocal constraint and facilitation, ”(p"
"Byrnes (1992 ) pointed out that fusing these theories is possible, since they are not mutually exclusive"
"Byrnes also noted that integrated views were increasingly sought, just as SRLbegan to gain in popularity"
"As we will see in the analysis that follows, this wide scope ofSRL comes with positive andnegative consequences in the empirical research"
"Method Search criteriaIn order to consider the state of metacognition, SR, and SRL in contemporary educational psychology literature, we created three study pools corresponding to the three constructs.These three pools were developed by sea rching PsychInfo using the keywords, metacognition ,self-regulation , and self-regulated learning , in separate searches"
"The keywords were not limited to title or abstract, in order to include all potentially relevantstudies"
"Due to the vast number of studies initially identified by these search parameters, we limited the search to empirical works published in the past 5 years (2003 –2007)"
"In addition, we hand searched the following journals to identify any suitable publications: Contemporary Educational Psychology ,Educational Psychologist ,Instruc- tional Science , and the Journal of Educational Psychology "
"In the hand search, we examined the last 5 years of each journal and scanned the titles and abstracts to find anypotential studies that may have been missed in the database search"
"In addition, we identifiedsome newer publications that were not available through either the database search or a physicalhand search"
"For example, the journal Metacognition and Learning was first published in 2006, and was not available in the database search, so it was added to our hand search"
"Lastly, in order to make relevant comparisons between these constructs, we limited studies to those in which academic learning or school performance was considered"
"academic learning, we refer to all school-related subjects (e.g., mathematics, science, reading, music, or physical education)"
"Academic learning in these studies could eitheroccur in naturalistic settings (e.g., the classroom) or in more contrived settings (e.g., thelaboratory)"
"The academic learning criterion significantly reduced the number of studiesoverall, but had differential effects on the final selection of documents for the three constructs"
"For instance, with metacognition, a number of excluded studies focused on clinical applications, such as work with alcohol abusers (e.g., Hoyer et al"
"2007 ) and the clinical treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or ADHD among children (e.g.,Knouse et al"
"Studies that were retained in the metacognition pool dealt broadly with academics whether in school (e.g., Jacobs 2004 ) or out of school (e.g., Metcalfe and Kornell 2005 )"
"Like metacognition, most excluded self-regulation studies pertained to clinical behaviors or undesired psychological habits, such as eating disorders or smokingbehaviors"
"Additionally, SR studies dealing with personality factors or personalitydisorders, such as phobias or emotional effects of traumatic brain injuries, were notconsidered in this analysis"
"Since SRL has generally been conceptualized to involve regulation within academic domains, most of those studies were retained"
"However, since we excluded studies of participants with clinically diagnosedproblems for both metacognition and self-regulation, we also excluded studies in SRL,although they were rare (e.g., Reid and Lienemann 2006 )"
"After inclusion criteria were set, we were still left with an impressive number of studies for all three constructs"
"The resultingpool included 255 studies (i.e., 123 metacognition, 54 self-regulation, and 78 self-regulatedlearning articles)"
"We organized studies into a comprehensive table with three designated sections corresponding to the constructs (i.e., metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulatedlearning)"
Studies within the table were organized first by year of publication and thenalphabetically by authors
"We analyzed each article according to the following: definitions of the constructs, measures used, measurement method (e.g., self-report), and instances of priming or cueing during a task"
"Due to its size and complexity, the full summary table isnot provided in this article but can be accessed online (see Supplementary Table )"
"The first two reasons pertained directly to the way in which studies are coded via keywords in thePsychInfo database, while the third issue related to the attention to multiple constructswithin the investigations"
"First, the extent to which each study identified through our searchparameters dealt expressly with any of the three constructs of interest proved problematic.Specifically, even though a given study was keyed to a particular construct within thedatabase (e.g., self-regulated learning), the particular construct was neither defined normeasured in the study"
"In certain instances, the terms metacognition ,self-regulation , and self-regulated learning may have been chosen by authors as a keyword for article cataloguing or one or more of these terms were mentioned peripherally in the theoreticalframing or discussion"
"For instance, Lizzio and Wilson ’s(2005 ) study was identified through our self-regulated learning search"
"In this study, self-regulated learning was not a construct ofinterest and only a passing reference was made to self-regulatory strategies in the discussionand conclusions"
"Second, many of the studies identified by the search parameters in PsychInfo actually referred to a different construct than the one keyed in the database"
This concern seemedmost evident for studies dealing with either self-regulation or self-regulated learning
"Forexample, an article by Mason ( 2004 ), dealing with the self-regulated strategy developmentEduc Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 395"
"Rather, the focus was on theSRSD as a strategy for teaching self-regulation to those with academic difficulties"
2006 ) were more accurately identified via keywords as part of the self-regulation search
"For such problematic studies, we relied on the contents of the investigation, rather than the keywords in the database, to position it within the appropriate section in the review table"
"Third, some studies defined and measured more than one of the constructs of interest"
"Although this problem was most salient with self-regulation and self-regulated learning,this issue occurred across all three constructs: metacognition and SR (e.g., Aleven et al"
"2006 ; Marchand and Skinner 2007 ), metacognition and SRL (e.g., Nietfeld et al"
"2005 ; Vandergrift 2005 ), and SR and SRL (e.g., van Grinsven and Tillema 2006 )"
"This issue seemed to be a direct result of the absorption of both metacognitive monitoring (e.g.,feelings of knowing) and the motivational aspects of self-regulation (e.g., self-efficacy) inSRL studies"
Our solution for this construct overlap was to determine which constructwas more prevalent in both its definition (if provided) and the measures employed
Studies of SR and SRL were often very similar in both their terminology and measurement and would define both constructs
"However, if the study contained ameasure such as the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) weincluded it as part of the self-regulated learning section of our table, since the MSLQ wasmore typical of SRL studies"
Thomas and Gadbois ’s(2007 ) study was illustrative of this coding issue
"Coding schemeDue to the large number of studies and the difficulty of differentiating between them for certain dimensions, we felt that an explicit scheme was essential to ensure that resulting codes were reliable and valid"
"Thus, we developed two broad categories of codes for each construct: definitions and measurement"
"Within the category of definitions, we identifiedthe extent to which authors explicitly defined the target constructs and identified trends indefinitional emphasis"
"For the category of measurement, we coded the data sources (e.g.,self-report or interview) and the alignment of definition to measurement, that is, thecorrespondence between conceptual and operational definition"
"Lastly, we examined studiesto determine the level of prompting or cueing in the experimental task or environment"
"Forthe table and the coding, we engaged in extensive discussion to ensure that the codes wereconsistent"
"In addition, initial codes underwent modification early in the process toaccommodate the diversity we encountered in the literature"
"Once issues with the codingscheme were resolved, the first and third authors classifying all identified studies with a high level of interrater agreement ( α>0.85) Clarity of definitions Our first step was to code the clarity of the definition provided in each study"
"When wemodeled this scheme from the Murphy and Alexander ( 2000 ) review, we had also anticipated a third definitional category, “absent, ”to apply when explicit or implicit codes were deemed inappropriate"
"However, no such entries appeared in our final analysis and,therefore, this third category was dropped"
Explicit definitions provided by the authors areitalicized in the table and coded as anE in the definitional codes column
"(2005 ) defined metacognition as having, “two components: knowledge about cognition and regulation of cognition"
Monitoring falls under the regulation facet of396 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409
metacognition and refers to one ’s awareness of comprehension and task performance while in the process of performing a specific task ”(p
"In addition to identifying explicit definitions, we also coded the various forms of implicit definitions found in these studies"
"Three forms of implied definitions were identified:conceptual definitions (C), where authors do not expressly state a definition but where words or phrases appeared in the text that alluded to meaning; referential definitions (R), where key references were applied as proxies for definitions; and measurement definition(M), where measures alone served as definitional markers"
"For instance, although Hole andCrozier ( 2007 ) never explicitly defined self-regulation, there was mention in the text of task persistence, cognitive engagement, help-seeking and choice of a future task as qualitiesassociated with self-regulation"
"We, thus, coded those words as indicative of the author ’s conceptualization of self-regulation (C)"
"In contrast, Efklides and Petkaki ( 2005 ) did not explicitly define the term metacognition , but provided a reference to Flavell ’s seminal writings, which we coded as a referential definition (R) for that construct"
"(2006 ) characterized self-regulation as intrinsic and identified motivation, and also referred the reader to Deci and Ryan ’s(1985 ) writings on the construct"
"Further, we used the measurement (M) code only whenno explicit, conceptual, or referential definitions were provided"
"For instance, Bråten andStrømsø ( 2005 ) did not provide an explicit definition for self-regulated learning , but operationalized it through the use of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire.All implied definitions were identified in the definitional codes column of table as an I along with a sub-code that depicted the type of implied definition (i.e., C, R, or M)"
Definitional emphasis The second focus of our definitional coding scheme centered on the common words or phrases that authors used to define the construct(s) of interest
"For theexplicit definitions only, we looked at words used expressly by the authors"
Our intention was to investigate the shared language or common phraseology that might frame each construct within the literature
We assumed that the presence of such a common lexicon would signal amore accepted view of these latent constructs within the research community
"Operationalization of definitions In order to understand construct operationalization within each study better, we listed the type of measurement used (e.g., self-report) in datagathering"
"Next, we identified the degree to which the construct definition provided by theauthor aligned to the measurement"
"In this endeavor, we used four types of codes: clearmatch between the definition and measure (F); partial match between the definition andmeasure (P); or an ill or poor match between the definition and measure (I)"
"For example, ifthe construct was defined as metacognitive knowledge, as in the van Gog et al"
"(2005 ) study, and metacognitive knowledge was what was actually measured —whether by researcher-designed or commercially available measures —we coded that as a clear match"
"If the study only measured part of the forwarded definition, we coded that as a partialmatch"
"(2007 ) study of self-regulation included a cognitive component in the definition, but did not include a dedicated measure of cognitive processes.Lastly, if the match between the definition and the measure was unclear or non-existent, wecoded this as an ill-match"
"For example, in Al-Hilawani ’s(2006 ) study, it was unclear how the definition of metacognition and the experimental picture task were related"
"In some cases, we were unable to identify a match between the definition and the measure"
"First, for cases with implied measure definitions,such as the Bråten and Strømsø ( 2005 ) study noted earlier, the researcher only defined theEduc Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 397"
"Thus, it was impossible for us to align the definition to the measure, as they were one in the same"
The second case for which alignment coding proved troubling occurred for studies incorporating treatment or training
"In these instances, subjects were taught to use metacognition, self-regulation, or self-regulated learning strategies in classroom or laboratory contexts"
"A common example of this type of study was self-regulated strategydevelopment training (e.g., Mason 2004 ), where subjects were taught self-regulation strategies to improve writing or reading performance"
"While many of these studies providedclear, explicated definitions of terms, some did not have a dependent measure of theconstruct due to the experimental design"
"Instead, the overall treatment condition wasmeasured through analysis of some other dependent measure, such as writing or readingperformance"
"Again, for these cases, the alignment code column of the table was left blank"
"Prompting and cueing Due to the co-emergence of self-regulated learning and hypermedia, studies in our analyses, especially for SRL, occasionally involved tasks with built-in prompts or cues"
"In the literature, prompting or cueing is often referred to as scaffolding"
"(2005 ) have delineated three classes scaffolding: fixed scaffolding, adaptive scaffolding, and no scaffolding"
"In fixed scaffolding, the prompts donot change relative to the learner's performance"
"Adaptive scaffolding, as the name implies, changes based on some form ofinput from the learner"
"For example, if the learner is performing well, prompts may not begiven, whereas, if the learner is performing poorly, prompts are provided or enhanced.Lastly, there is the no-scaffolding condition, where prompts are not present at all"
Thesethree levels of prompting are provided by both humans and computers in the literature
"scheme in this analysis to indicate whether fixed scaffolding (FS), adaptive scaffolding (AS), or no scaffolding (NS) was provided"
"Further, for studies that included fixed or adaptive scaffolding, we coded instances as human (H) or computer (C) prompting"
"General Trends and Emerging Concerns Once our search of the recent literature and the coding of resulting studies had been reliably accomplished, we set out to discern any relevant patterns within these data that pertaineddirectly to construct definition, construct measurement, or other empirical or educationalissues"
"In some instances, we perceive these patterns as interesting but not necessarilyproblematic trends within these growing literatures"
"In other cases, however, we feel that the pattern merits more concern among researchers who are pursuing this line of inquiry"
"Explication of definitionsIn order to extract the salient attributes of metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning from the literature, we investigated the degree to which researchers explicatedthose terms"
The underlying assumption that we made in this analysis was that explicitdefinitions are more desirable than implied definitions because the reader is not left to inferthe meaning of the term
"When definitions are implied through allusion to meanings ofspecific words or phrases in the text (i.e., conceptual), by citation to key referents (i.e.,referential), or through measurement parameters (i.e., measurement), the onus is on398 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409"
consumers of that research to extrapolate the authors ’intended meaning of the construct
"Such a burden would be questionable when terms have a set or common meaning amongresearchers or practitioners, but it may be even a more precarious venture for fields likeeducation for which the lexicon can be amorphous and open to interpretation (Alexander et al.1991 )"
"In our review of the literature, we considered explication of definitions across and within constructs"
"Across constructs, we found that 49% of target terms were explicitly defined bythe researchers, while 51% of target terms were implicitly defined"
"As shown in Table 1, implied definitions were further described as either conceptual or referential, or defined bymeasurement"
Frequency and relative percent of implied definitions by construct isprovided in Table 1
Of interest was the proportion of explicit definitions provided within each construct
Explicit definitions occurred more frequently in the self-regulation (31/54; 57%) and self-regulated learning literatures (54/78; 69%) than in the literature on metacognition (39/123;32%)
We can forward three possible explanations why there is less explication of metacognition within the literature
"First, as we alluded to earlier, SR and SRL have closer ties to neobehaviorism, where the requirement to provide explicit operational definitions ismore common"
"Second, perhaps researchers assume that metacognition is a rather well- established term that needs no further clarification beyond a suitable citation"
"In contrast tothe relatively complex interaction of behavior, cognition, and motivation emphasized in theSR and SRL literature, there is a deceptively simple conceptualization of metacognitionsuch as “thinking about thinking"
"”Third, it is also possible that there is more theoretical diversity represented in the SR and SRL research as compared to the more clearly cognitiveperspective signaled by metacognition"
"Thus, researchers in SR and SRL find the explicitdefinition of their constructs a means to align their research with a particular segment of theliterature be it more social cognitive, as in the writings of Zimmerman and Schunk ( 2001 ), more cognitive behavioral modification for Graham et al"
"(2007 ), or more information- processing, as in the work of Azevedo and colleagues (e.g., Azevdeo and Cromley 2004 )"
"However, regardless of the reasoning, reliance on implicit definitions is a concern"
One notable observation was the low frequency of referential definitions across constructs
"Itwas more common for referential definitions to be presented in combination withconceptual allusions to meaning (i.e., I-C/R notation) rather than to find referent-onlydefinitions"
"This finding was promising because, although the authors did not provideexplicit definitions, they did supply multiple opportunities for the reader to infer meaning"
Table 1 Frequency and Relative Percent of Implied Definitions by Construct Definitional category Construct Metacognition Self-regulation Self-regulated learningf Percentf Percentf Percent Conceptual 40 48 07 30 07 29 Referential 08 10 00 00 03 13Conceptual/referential 23 27 09 39 05 21Measure 13 15 07 30 09 38Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 399
A second interesting finding related to definitions that were inferred from measures
"Of the studies that provided implied definition, self-regulation (38%) and self-regulatedlearning (30%) were more likely than metacognition (15%) to be defined only by theparameters of measures"
This finding is particularly interesting in light of the relatively highproportion of explicit definitions of self-regulation andself-regulated learning
"Specifically, these data suggest almost a feast or famine of definitional clarity in the SR and SRL literatures"
"That is, researchers were either very meticulous in defining their core constructsor relied on the weakest mode of definition for self-regulation and self-regulated learning,namely the measure or measures selected"
Another notable trend occurred in the repetition of keywords in explicit definitions
"Seven words were routinely found in explicit definitions across the three constructs.Specifically, the keywords were monitor ,control ,regulate ,cognition ,motivation ,behavior , andknowledge "
"Variants of keywords were included in the analysis (e.g., behaviors or behaving )"
The percent of keyword occurrences within each construct is presented in Table 2
The percentages and frequencies refer to the number of studies in which the keyword appeared in the explicit definition
"We elected not to code the nesting term cognition formetacognition , or the word regulation for either self-regulation orself- regulated learning "
"First, the keywords in explicit definitions revealed differential research emphases for each of the constructs.Specifically, explicit definitions of self -regulation and self -regulated learning were broadly focused, as evidenced by the high proportions of cognition ,motivation , and behavior keywords"
"Conversely, explicit metacognition definitions were more narrowly constrainedwithin the cognitive realm, with minimal instances of motivation orbehavior as keywords"
These data made sense in light of our discussion of the historical roots of these threeconstructs
"Second, the frequency of word choice across the constructs suggested a conceptual overlap"
"Specifically, the explicit words and phrases associated with self-regulation and self-regulated learning were quite similar"
"Both construct definitions frequently referenced behavior ,motivation ,cognition ,monitoring , and control , but the word knowledge was far less evoked"
The pattern of emphasis may suggest a nesting of the two constructs
"Specifically,these data might suggest that SRL may be a special case of self-regulation (i.e., self-regulation in an academic context)"
Nesting of metacognition with self-regulation and self-regulated learning might also be inferred from these data
"In fact, the keywords monitor and Table 2 Frequency and Percent of Keywords in the Explicit Definitions by Construct Definitional category Construct Metacognition Self-regulation Self-regulated learningf Percentf Percentf Percent Monitor 20 51 11 35 21 39 Control 19 49 12 39 18 33Regulate 17 44 –– Cognition – 15 48 23 43 Motivation 01 03 13 42 27 50Behavior 02 05 13 42 21 39Knowledge 23 59 02 06 08 15400 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409"
"Although the two terms are most obviously associated with Flavell ’s(1979 ) description of metacognition, these results suggest that monitoring and control are likewise conceived as an aspect of self-regulation and self-regulated learning"
Further evidence of this conceptual overlap can befound from data collected using instruments measuring both metacognition and self- regulated learning (Sperling et al
"2004 ; for a further discussion of this issue, see Veenman 2007 )"
"Differences between metacognition, SR, and SRL may lie in what is being monitored or controlled"
"In self-regulation and self-regulated learning, monitoring orcontrol may refer to behavior, cognition, or motivation, while metacognition likelyemphasizes monitoring and control of cognition, specifically"
"The high percentage of implied definitions, overlap of explicit definition keywords, as well as the potential nesting of constructs, contributed to the difficult task of organizingdata by construct"
The challenge we experienced in attempting to untangle these threeconstructs indicated that the clarity and boundaries of these constructs were issues to beaddressed
Definition and measurement alignment Perhaps the most difficult task for us was aligning the explicit and implicit definitions forwarded by researchers with the measures they used
"Overall, these data suggest that the definitional measurement alignment was better for the SRL literature than for studies of metacognitionand self-regulation, which produced similar alignment patterns"
"Specifically, more than92% of the SRL studies evidenced full alignment between what was defined and what wasmeasured, as compared to 71% and 63% full alignment for metacognition and self-regulation studies, respectively"
"However, these data and the coding scheme we employed may not tell the complete story"
"We also found issues of measurement clarity, scope, type of measurement, and scaffolding"
"First, as with the definitional clarity, there was noticeable variability in thedegree to which measures were explicated by researchers"
"Often, we struggled to identifyexactly what was being measured, particularly when authors created their own instrumentsand when only one or two items from those researcher-designed measures were provided intext"
"In such cases, there was no way to ascertain whether the sample items wererepresentative of the measure as a whole"
"Also, if the definition itself had to interpreted, we were forced to make two interpretations of these data to try to judge the conceptual –operational link"
"Second, since we found evidence in these data that these constructs are nested, comparisons between Table 3 Percent Alignment of Definition to Measures by Construct Definitional category Construct Metacognition Self-regulation Self-regulated learningf Percentf Percentf Percent Full 76 71 24 63 60 92 Partial 21 20 09 24 5 08Ill 10 09 05 13 0 00Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 401"
"The scope of SRL was quite large and typically the measures of SRL were also broad, often involving general measures of academic behavior.For example, many of the SRL studies included in this review relied on the MSLQ (Pintrichet al"
"The MSLQ is a self-report measure that includes motivation scales tapping into students ’values, expectancies, and affect, and a learning strategies section that surveys students ’use of cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management strategies"
Types of measuresThe types of measures used in the studies from our table varied widely
"Those types of measurement were: self-reports, observations, think-aloud protocols, interviews, accuracy ratings, and diaries"
"Fromour examination of these data, it is clear that self-report was the dominant type of measurefor all three of these constructs, at nearly 43%"
"However, different patterns emerged whenthe constructs were examined separately (see Table 4)"
"As suggested, the reliance on self-report was much greater for SRL and SR"
"Although the argument could be made that the accuracy ratings (e.g., judgments of learning or JOL and feelings of knowing or FOK) are also self-reports, these measures differed in one keyaspect from the classification of self-reports in our coding scheme"
"Specifically, whenaccuracy ratings were used, they were used in conjunction with an experimental task (e.g., avocabulary task)"
"This key difference in measurement (task involvement) not onlycontextualized learners ’estimation of their cognitive ability, but also typically involved a posttest to correlate performance estimates with actual outcomes"
"To us, it seems unlikelythat isolated or decontextualized self-reports for SR and SRL studies would uncover thecomplex interactions that are at the heart of the conceptual definitions that frame theseliterature"
"Rather, it would seem that additional evidence would be needed or corroborateindividuals ’monitoring or regulatory reports, especially when researchers are attempting to make causal claims related to these constructs"
"Prompting and cueingThe co-emergence of SRL and computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), such as hypermedia, has introduced an added layer of complexity in many of these studies"
"Often,this layer of complexity in CBLEs involves some type of prompting or cueing, oftenreferred to in the literature as scaffolding"
"As described in the “Method ”section, we not Table 4 Frequency and Percent of Measurement Type by Construct Measurement type Construct Metacognition Self-regulation Self-regulated learningf Percentf Percentf Percent Self-report 29 24 37 73 44 59 Observation 24 20 10 20 12 16 Think-aloud 14 12 00 00 10 13 Interviews 16 13 02 04 07 09Performance ratings 38 31 01 02 02 03Diaries 00 00 01 02 00 00402 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409"
"only wanted to document the presence of scaffolding in studies, but also the source of that scaffolding"
"Specifically, we coded whether scaffolds were provided by humans, computers,or some combination thereof"
"Often, even in situations where monitoring or regulatory datawere self-reported, there was some type of training or intervention occurring formetacognitive or self-regulatory skills"
"For example, in Mason ’s(2004 ) study, strategy training was provided in the classroom"
We made that judgment based on the description of the training or intervention included in the methods section of each study
"The frequency and percent of studies that used fixed scaffolding, adaptive scaffolding, no scaffolding, or training are displayed in Table 5"
The breakdown of those scaffolded studies according to the source of the prompts and cues is shown in Table 6
The most obvious trend in the data is the limited presence of scaffolding in self-regulated studies.This outcome likely reflects the infrequent reliance on experimental or performance tasks inthese studies
"However, for metacognition and SRL, which both had a greater number ofstudies involving experimental or performance tasks, important differences were evident inthe data"
"One interesting trend we noted was the comparable reliance on computer andhuman scaffolding for both metacognition and SRL (for a more in-depth discussion of SRL and hypermedia, see Winters et al"
"Because a substantial number of SRL research involved hypermedia, we had expected a higher presence for computer scaffolding in thisliterature"
"For us, the presence of scaffolding in the environment, whether computer based or not, presents a potential confound in the results regarding these constructs, particularly that ofSRL"
"modification or CBM studies like those of Graham and Harris (e.g., Graham et al"
"2007 ; Harris 1986 ), and without the inclusion of delayed posttesting or transfer tasks that suggest enduring changes in monitoring or regulation, it is difficult to tell if these scaffolds, whichare cases of other-regulation, actually translate into instances of self-regulation"
Final Frames: What was Seen and What Remains to be Seen We began this review with the inspiring yet unnerving words of Ludwig Wittgenstein who cautioned all who would listen to regard the power of language
"For those of us who havededicated our lives to the education of others and to the empirical study of human learningand development, there is no avoiding the fact that there is a relation between clarity andprecision of language and the ideas that take shape in the mind"
"Despite Wittgenstein ’s proclamation that “everything that can be said can be said clearly ”(1922/ 2003 ,p"
"53), we do not believe that language, even the language of research, can be completelydisambiguated"
"Nonetheless, we would concur that there are many instances when researchers in this domain contribute to the conceptual haze that blurs their messages and confounds their educational mission"
"We engaged in this systematic review of the literaturesin metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning with the expressed hope thatwe would be able to lift the conceptual haze and, to some extent, locate areas of constructclarity"
"There were, indeed, outcomes of this detailed analysis that left us optimistic, butother trends failed to alleviate prior concerns or raised more questions"
"The conceptual coreEven though there are distinct histories to the literatures on metacognition and self- regulation, and a still emerging presence to self-regulated learning, we found important commonalities in the words and phrases used explicitly and implicitly by the authors to define these terms"
"These commonalities reveal an undeniable conceptual core binding thethree constructs, namely, that individuals make efforts to monitor their thoughts and actionsand to act accordingly to gain some control over them"
"It is, in effect, a marriage betweenself-awareness and intention to act that aligns these bodies of work"
"Yet, it should not be assumed that the conceptual core serves as justification for the treatment of metacognition ,self-regulation , and self-regulated learning as synonymous terms or conceptual givens"
"To the contrary, it requires those in the educational researchcommunity to be even more vigilant in their attributions and delineations: To mean whatthey say and to say what they mean"
"Beyond their shared core, there are conceptualdistinctions or differences that researchers must acknowledge if they are to choose the appropriate construct to address their research question"
"Further, careful explication of the construct would go a long way to lifting the conceptual haze that overlays these relatedliteratures"
"Points of convergence and divergenceThroughout this review, we made reference to “nesting ”or“overlap ”when describing the associations between metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning"
We wantto focus more on these perceived associations and our evidence for those perceptions
"Aswe progress in this discussion, however, it is imperative to remember that conceptions ofthese constructs are not stagnant or fixed, rather they continue to move and take shape over404 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409"
"When first conceived, for instance, metacognition and self-regulation reflected the varied theoretical roots of their progenitors"
"1970 ) were developmental psychologists who were most concerned with how individuals ’ awareness of their thoughts took form through maturation and experience, whereas Bandura(1977 ) was especially interested in the person –environment –action dynamic in his articulation of self-regulation"
"Thus, in these roots, we see a clear cognitive orientation for metacognition, while self-regulation is as much concerned with human action than thethinking that engendered it"
"Incidentally, neither Flavell nor Bandura was especially dedicatedto the role of these processes in learning or in academic contexts"
That implication andapplication would come from others who carried these constructs into academic domains(Zimmerman and Schunk 2001 ) and into classrooms (Graham et al
"When we look at metacognition and self-regulation today, we can still catch glimpses of their varied roots"
"Specifically, as the prominence of metacognitive strategies grew and the relationbetween self-awareness and cognitive response took hold, metacognition began to ventureinto the realm of behavior more associated with self-regulation"
"Moreover, when self- regulation began to target the cognitive realm rather than the psychosocial or behavioral domains, its correspondence to metacognition became increasingly pronounced"
"Whatremains to us as a distinction, however, are the differential emphases on the role of theenvironment"
"For many self-regulation researchers, it is the environment that stimulatesindividuals ’awareness and their regulatory responses"
"In contrast, those researching metacognition look to the mind of the individual as the initiator or trigger for subsequentjudgments or evaluations"
"When we factor in the newest member of this regulatory triad, self-regulated learning, there are additional entanglements that must be addressed"
"For one, what distinguishes SRLfrom its predecessors is its exclusive focus on academic learning"
"Unlike metacognition orself-regulation, SRL did not find its way into the classroom or academic realm, it began there"
"Though the term “learning ”more narrowly focused this construct, it also resulted in dual interpretations of its meaning"
"Specifically, we came to the conclusion through thisreview that there are actually two classes of SRL research"
There are those individuals whoare actually engaged in self-regulation research but who affix the word learning to situate the work within the academic domain
"By contrast, there are those for who self-regulatedlearning has more to do with the person –environment interaction, where the computer is a key to task delivery and to the scaffolding providing during task performance"
"The otherobservation to be made about self-regulated learning as a body of work is that there is theintention, especially among those who i nvolve hypermedia, to bring elements of metacognition and self-regulation together, that is, intention to span both researchtraditions"
The measurement conundrum One of the troubling issues that we must confront from this analysis is the nature and quality of the measures that were plied to uncover individuals ’monitoring or regulatory behaviors
"First, it would seem to us that efforts to bring precision to the language ofmetacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulatory learning would remain a somewhathollow enterprise if there is not a concomitant effort to find more precise measures of suchprocesses"
"Sadly, in our survey of the research, we found that there remained a strongreliance on self-report and Likert-type instruments and insufficient corroboration orcollaboration of what individuals report they are thinking or doing with actual traces ofEduc Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409 405"
"Further, it is unclear how very broad-brush measures that seek to generalize across multiple times and situations, as well asacross cognitive, motivational, emotional, and behavioral domains, can fairly and accurately gauge monitoring or capture the dynamic interplay of person, environment,and behavior that is the hallmark of self-regulation"
"With the advancements in technology and with the acceptance of multimethod studies, we have the opportunity to go wider and deeper in our examinations of monitoring andregulation"
"We have the chance, as Winne and colleagues are doing, to build tasks that maynot only instigate awareness, reflection, or regulation, but that will also document subtlemoves and actions with minimum intrusion"
"Similarly, there is the opportunity to use moreethnographic or phenomenological techniques to probe the thoughts, explanations, andjustifications of those who are engaged in academic tasks for which monitoring orregulation would be anticipated"
"It may be that neither quantitative nor qualitativeapproaches alone will suffice to illuminate the nature of monitoring and regulation, but thatsome combination is required"
"Development and longitudinal studies When Flavell and colleagues began to explore metacognition, they were particularly interested in how this process of thinking about thinking emerged in young children"
"Yet, itwas surprising to us that, in this review, questions about development, particularly inrelation to self-regulation and self-regulated learning were relatively rare"
"Due to itsdevelopmental roots, metacognition has dealt more so with developmental aspects (e.g.,Alexander et al"
"2003 ; Veenman and Spaans 2003 ), but researchers are still seeking to ascertain who monitors or regulates and when, what types of environments stimulatemonitoring and regulation, and how monitoring and regulation are tied to academicperformance"
"As valuable as these questions are, it would seem equally important to ask whether the nature of monitoring and regulation changes over time not only through maturation but also as a consequence of changing knowledge, interests, goals, andexperiences"
"It would also be important to know whether there is a propensity to bemonitoring or self-regulating, or if such processes are more likely triggered by conditionswithin the immediate environment"
"In effect, what is the evidence that the prompting and cueing wewitnessed in many studies can be faded or eliminated, eventually being replaced by internaltriggers or “habits of mind ”"
"What is required to turn “other ”regulation into “self” regulation, for instance"
"These are just a few of the developmental questions that cannot beanswered by cross-sectional or short-term investigations, even when the constructs in thoseinvestigations are nicely explicated, the measures well aligned, and the data competently analyzed"
"Degrees of separationThere is no question that there is a rich and growing literature related to metacognition, self- regulation, and self-regulated learning"
"Even when we constrained our current examinationto the academic realm, we were faced with the daunting task of analyzing and synthesizingwell over 200 documents"
We had hoped that this endeavor would bring us (and perhaps thebroader educational community) closer to comprehending the nature and associationsbetween these three vital programs of research
Part of that risk comes as programs406 Educ Psychol Rev (2008) 20:391 –409
