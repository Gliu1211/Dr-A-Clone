SENTENCES
"learners often differ in the environment in which they prefer to learn (e.g., group learning vs"
"independent study) and in theirpreferred study medium (e.g., digital or print style)"
"1,2Some learners respond well to simulation tasks, while others learnbetter by watching their teachers work clinically on real pa-tients"
"Advancements in technology have widened the dif- ferences in adults ’approaches to learning by broadening the options they have for gathering information, acquiringknowledge, and honing their skills"
"3However, the overreli- ance on or misuse of technology has been criticized as acrutch"
"4For better or worse, both teaching and assessment have gravitated toward technology"
"Standardized assessments,question banks, virtual lectures and conferences, ﬂashcards, e- books, online simulations, and more have saturated the market for medical students"
"In this article, we attempt to answer the question: Is technology always the best resource for learning, and how can it be best utilized"
Residents must ﬁnd an effective way to manage that deluge of information if they are to learn what isessential and not ﬁnd themselves swept away
"Yet, without guidance, even these mature students may ﬁnd themselves ill-equipped to cull key concepts or critical content from all the onlineinformation they encounter"
"5It may seem unnecessary to teach adult learners who have grown up with digital technologieshow to engage with them more effectively, but in actuality,these individuals are not always as ef ﬁcient with digital mediums as they suppose themselves to be"
"6,7They may be facile at maneuvering through the latest technologies, tech features, and apps, but they still require instruction that fo- cuses on evaluating, synthesizing, and integrating the infor-mation they locate online"
"8,9They also can be susceptible to biased, inaccurate, and intentionally misleading contentpopulating digital media"
"10 In understanding where the learner is with respect to the efﬁcient use of smart technologies, we must take into question the concept of digital readiness"
"First, the adult learner in residency must have digital skills capable of ini- tiating useful online sessions and browsing resources andvarious databases"
"Second, trust is a vital component when determining the accuracy of information online"
"8Finally, use determines the degree to which the adult learner can carry outtasks with the digital tools at their disposal"
"Technology todaycomes equipped with a large array of tools not available in the print-only world that can facilitate reading and learning from texts, including apps for annotation and notecards, digitalglossaries, and tools for collaborating"
"11Yet, the availability of these many digital tools does not ensure their smart use.Therefore, while it may seem counterintuitive, learners requirestrategic guidance if they are to engage ef ﬁciently and ef- fectively with digital texts and tools in a manner that promotescomprehension and retention"
"12,13Those strategies may in- clude monitoring one ’s understanding, reading more slowly,periodically stopping to re ﬂect on or ask questions about what was read, annotating digital texts, and writing down on paperkey points or questions"
"13,14“Digitally Ready ”adults must be conﬁdent in their online skills, accurately distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy online information, and haveenough familiarity with technology to utilize its advantages"
"4 In residency, there are often competing demands and, consequently, decreased time for re ﬂection and engagement with material, which can lead to burnout ( Figure 1 ).15Virtual lectures have recently increased in popularity"
COVID-19pandemic forced physicians to rapidly adapt and integratenew technologies into daily practice and into medicaleducation
"16,17For instance, recent studies on virtual lectures during the COVID-19 pandemic found that one of the sig- niﬁcant downfalls of a virtual curriculum was the loss of student –faculty interaction.16-18One technique that might help maintain connections between students and facultyduring online lectures is the use of polling systems like PollEverywhere®"
These systems can also allow teachers toquickly gauge students ’understanding of key points in the lectures before moving on
Real-time polling could also serveas a catalyst for class discussions of issues
The infrequent assessments that are part of medical school programs do not and cannot cover all the material residents areexpected to learn
"Thus, medical students and residents wantto self-assess frequently to monitor their progress and keepcontent fresh in memory"
"19For that reason, these learners often spend a good amount of their personal funds on questionbanks and other daily forms of self-assessment"
"However,some useful simulations and scenario-based tools (e.g., Step 3 CCS case simulator software) are simply out of reach ﬁ- nancially and technologically for many students"
"Even though reading from a textbook has gained a reputationas an “old-school ”style of learning, it is still considered a tried-and-true staple of learning in residency"
One study by Singer and Alexander explored the differences in compre- hension of 90 undergraduate students who read both digitaland print versions of news articles and book excerpts ontopics of childhood ailments
"2Not surprisingly with mil- lennials and subsequent generations that have grown up withInternet access and smart devices, survey results demon-strated a signi ﬁcant preference for digital text"
"Paradoxically, when those undergraduates were asked to recall key points linked to the main idea andother relevant information of the passages, their compre-hension was signi ﬁcantly better when they read the printed and not the digital text —evidence that these students were poorly calibrated"
"Singer Trakhman proposed that underlying differences may be the result of navigational30S Ear, Nose & Throat Journal 101(9S)"
"issues with the document.14For example, research has shown that effective readers use the location of information on theprinted page to prompt their recall"
"20,21When reading digi- tally, this sense of location is disrupted due to scrolling; in fact,scrolling itself negatively affects comprehension perfor-mance"
"22Another factor that affected digital reading perfor- mance across several studies was reading time.22Speci ﬁcally, students were found to read signi ﬁcantly faster on screen than on print, which could mean that they were not paying closeattention to the content when they were online"
"In a person-center analysis that looked at an array of navigational be-haviors students exhibited during digital reading in relation tocomprehension, they identi ﬁed 4 distinct learner pro ﬁles: 23 1"
"Regulators —those who exhibited a reliance on deeper processing behaviors (re-reading, moving purposefullyback and forth in the text, and posing questions)"
Plodders —those who moved linearly through text but at a noticeably slower pace
Samplers —those who only selectively exhibited deeper processing behaviors (searching through texts for speci ﬁc sentences or phrases that might help them answer the mainidea and key points)
Regulators and Gliders registered the best comprehension scores and were better calibrated than Plodders and Samplersboth in print and digitally
"Depending on their online readingproﬁles, medical students and residents may likewise ﬁnd their comprehension of digital texts negatively affected"
"In addition, despite its notable advantages, technology can be a signi ﬁcant distractor"
"According to Matei, who monitored phone use with the RescueTime app, the average personspends more than 3 hours per day on their cell phone, notincluding television and laptop use time"
"24The act of usingpersonal devices for learning creates the unintended conse- quences of distraction and impulse to multitask (e.g., checkingemails, text messages, and social media)"
"Despite what the label suggests and what many students believe, multitasking isdetrimental to learning since no one can perform 2 tasks si- multaneously unless one of those tasks is entirely habituated (e.g., brushing teeth and walking)"
Numerous research studieshave established this fact and have shown that technologyencourages multitasking
25-27The impetus for such multi- tasking often involved such tasks as responding to incomingtext messages and e-mails or checking in with social networksites
27 The growing presence of technology in graduate medical education has thus become a double-edged sword
"The adult learner is now burdened with information saturation,the proliferation of misleading and malicious onlinecontent, the struggle to use valid evidence to support claims,and the tendency to treat complex issues in an overly sim-plistic fashion"
5The high workload of graduate medical ed- ucation training fosters an environment that encouragesmultitasking and technology can contribute to constant dis- tractions
"28Nonetheless, despite such pitfalls technology has become an essential tool in residency training.29It provides easy access to limitless resources, surgical videos, anatomysoftware, and spaced repetition notecards"
"Vula, an open-access atlas designed to provide free otolaryngology opera-tive information to the developing world, and other resourcescan be invaluable sources of critical information in a timelyand affordable manner"
"Similarly, social media in medicine (e.g., MedTwitter) has been shown to increase publication citations and is helpful for staying in-the-know on medicalguidelines and updates"
"As technology developments continueto transform the delivery of clinical medicine, so too will itcontinue to impact the manner in which medical students andresidents become doctors"
Burnout cycle experienced by too many medical students and residents.Steehler et al
"When we juxtapose the demands placed on medical students and residents with the ways in which they are being taught, it is evident that the conditions for optimal learning and perfor- mance rarely exist"
"Thus, to function in these non-optimalconditions, many students revert to an information manage-ment mindset instead of investing in knowledge building"
30 Information management is a general approach to learning that entails doing what is minimally necessary to get throughthe array of assigned tasks or responsibilities
"Often thatmeans that students work to acquire whatever knowledge or skills they see as needed in the short term, focusing on the content they view as pertinent to the tasks upon which theywill be judged"
"Because information management is so heavilytied to tasks and responsibilities that may be short-lived, re-taining what is learned through this approach can be prob-lematic"
"When the tasks and duties are completed and thedemand is no longer pressing, the associated learning can fadefrom memory"
"In contrast to information management, knowledge building is an approach to learning whereby the students are invested in acquiring knowledge and skills that theyconsider valuable and essential for their current and future success"
"30 As shown in Figure 2 , what content draws their attention and time during learning is based on what they perceive as im-portant and credible information"
"The understandings theyacquire are intentionally and strategically linked to prior learning forming an interconnected, principled body of knowledge that is apt to endure in memory and be morereadily retrievable when the need arises"
"Moreover, thatprincipled body of knowledge allows learners to criticallyjudge the information they subsequently encounter in print,online, or in lectures"
Knowledge builders do not simplyaccept what they see or hear at face value —they weigh its veracity and usefulness
"31 One reason for the prevalence of the information manage- ment approach to learning, even among very capable indi-viduals, is that the educational system does not teach studentshow to be knowledge builders"
"On the contrary, the nature of school at all levels is too often about covering as much content as possible and focusing on test performance as indicators ofsuccess"
"30Mature learners like medical students and residents, therefore, need to rethink the very mindset and work habits thatproved success throughout much of their prior educationalexperience"
"Although the mental effort and strategic processesinvolved in knowledge building may initially be unfamiliar andmore time-consuming than those aligned with information management, their repeated use can lead to habits of mind that are second nature and that will serve medical students andresidents throughout their careers"
"Further, this personal in-vestment in knowledge building will be invaluable for anyonewho hopes to become highly competent or even an expert in themedical profession"
"31In fact, there is no other path to high competence or expertise in any complex ﬁeld"
"However, we can offer some guidance in that regard: ·Think of your professional training as interconnected and a process of expertise development that requirestime and personal investment that cannot be rushed"
"·Operate with a knowledge building mindset and be aware of when ,where , and whyyou shift to information management"
·Self-test understanding frequently as you are learning to identify content that requires reinforcement
·Learn to question and challenge information as it is encountered; healthy skepticism leads to deeper learning Figure 2
"·Employ technology to assist in structuring what you read, heard, or view into meaningful chunks (e.g., ill-ness scripts; iconic images; families of cases)"
"·Learn to bootstrap your knowledge by forming con- nections between new topics, subjects, procedures, andwhat you already know"
"30,32 Before we leave this topic of information management and knowledge building, it is important to establish that both theseapproaches to learning are necessary within professionaleducation"
"Given the overload of infor- mation and high workload in medical school and duringresidency, it can be easy to revert to information management.Nonetheless, there is a time and place for information man-agement even as students are striving to become knowledgebuilders"
"The key for these learners is to be aware and in-tentional about when, where, and why to engage in infor-mation management or knowledge building and to use technologies wisely to assist in these processes"
"If, as we have suggested, the tendency for information management to take hold in learners at all academic levels isattributable in part to their educational experiences, it is worth considering what changes in those experiences should occur if knowledge building is to be promoted"
"It has been said that school curricula are a mile wide and an inch deep, and each year the material to be taught and to be learned grows"
33This reality leaves teachers who feel obliged to “cover the content ”doing little more than just mentioning everything and not really teaching anything.Mentioning puts the onus on learners who often lack suf-ﬁcient background and guidance to ﬁll in the informational gaps the best they can
"34However, if knowledge building is the goal, then it is essential for teachers to be far moreselective in what content th ey highlight and they need to allow more time for their students to re ﬂect on and apply what they are learning"
Apprenticeships have existed for centuries as a way for master craftsmen to pass along their collective wisdom to promising newcomers
These master craftsmen would model some portion ofa complex task and then diligently observe as the apprentice tried to replicate that process
Feedback and more modeling might followuntil the apprentice was able to exe cute that piece of the task well
"In muchthe same way, attending physicians and instructors working withresidents should see themselves in the role of master craftsmen who model and guide their apprentices"
"As such, they need to be cognizant of their residents ’strengths and needs, ensure these apprentices have ample opportuniti es to practice under their careful supervision, and offer whatever instructive feedback is required"
35 ·Signal what is particularly important for learners to know and be able to do
"When new topics or procedures are being presented to medical students and residents, it is not only helpful to teachmore about less but also to signal speci ﬁce le ment so ft he content that deserves greater attention from those learners"
Theresearch on information processing has shown the value ofsignaling for acquiring and retaining information
"36Signals can be trigger words like ﬁrst,principal ,o ressential, or they may take the form of bolded or italicized words and phrases, summaries, or other visual cues"
Periodically summarizing or restating whathas been shared can also reinforce key ideas
Another wayinstructors can help learners navigate the ﬂow of information is by providing them with an online advanced organizer that liststhe main points or terms to be covered
"Students can then use theorganizer for notetaking (e.g., reMarkable 2 or other tablets)"
Another practical step that instructors can take to guide students ’learning is to restructure the body of content around a topic into smaller bite-size segments interspersed with op-portunities to practice and apply the just-taught subject matter
"37,38The micro-lessons can make effective use of technology to present supportive videos, application mate-rials, or mini-assessments"
"These bite-size approaches alsoallow for small group interactions where critical content canbe discussed, rehearsed, and possibly extended"
A substantial number of medical programs internationally have taken an alternative approach to manage the extensivebody of knowledge and skills that medical students andresidents must master
"39,40Traditionally, instruction unfolds byﬁrst building up students ’foundational knowledge and skills and then applying the acquired content to cases"
