SENTENCES
"For example, the controversy presently circulating in educa-tional outlets (e.g., Goodwin, 2020), the popular press (Strauss, 2019), and social media (e.g., Loewus, 2019) speaks about reading and whether it should be taught by means of phonics or whole-word approaches"
"The reality is that reading does not begin or end with phonics or whole-word instruction (Seidenberg, 2013)"
"Reading, broadly conceived, is any interaction between a person—be it a child, adoles-cent, or adult—and written language (Pearson & Cervetti, 2013)"
"That interaction can involve written language at many levels, from words and sentences, to paragraphs, to entire volumes (Shanahan, 2019)"
"Also, reading can be performed for many reasons, from purely personal to largely academic, and in many contexts, both in and out of school, as well as online or in print (Ito et al., 2013; Singer & Alexander, 2017)"
This reconceptualization of reading also requires some adjustment in what qualifies as text
"Certainly, texts still encompass many well-known, traditional forms, such as works of fiction, exposition, folk tales, picture books, biography, and poetry.Y et, for today’s students, fondly referred to as the iGeneration or iGens (Twenge, 2017), many nontraditional, nonacademic, and ever- evolving forms of text are part of their reading experi- ences"
"Those alternative texts commonly found online and in social media include text messages, tweets, blogs, websites, memes, and podcasts.Reading Development Although I appreciate that some engaged in the ongoing “science of reading” debate have attempted to expand dis- cussion beyond the simple issue of phonics versus whole- word instruction (Shanahan, 2019; Willingham, 2017), nonetheless, the narrow conception of reading aligned to the “science of reading” controversy has also contributed to a myopic view of reading development"
"Specifically, from the tenor of the interactions found in the popular press and social media, there is the distinct impression that reading development begins when very young children first realize that linguistic symbols convey meaning and that those symbols are associated with certain sounds, making them pronounceable"
"Then, development is thought to end when children can process a fair amount of text fluently and with understanding"
"The problem with that too familiar conceptualization is that it captures only some portion of the initial phase of a lifelong developmental process (Alexander, 2005)"
"There are certainly critical neurophysiological factors involved in reading that take form in vitro, long before any informal or formal reading instruction can occur (Gabrieli, Christodoulou, O’Loughlin, & Eddy, 2010; Wolf, 2008)"
That is not to imply that reading develop- ment can be charted solely or even primarily on the basis of structural or functional characteristics of the brain or body
"Reading is as much, if not more, a social and cul-tural phenomenon as a neurophysiological one (Gutiérrez, 2008; Ito et al., 2013; Leu et al., 2015)"
"What must also be understood is that reading devel- opment does not end in third, sixth, or even 10th grade (Alexander, 2005)"
"Quite to the contrary, it is still ongoing among the undergraduate and graduate students I teach"
"As an older adult, I am still learning to read in that I am still building word knowledge, adapting to the new forms of texts, and devising strategies for coping with declining visual acuity"
"The bottom line is that as long as there are increasingly more complex or novel forms of text to be read, as long as the text-based tasks to be performed grow more difficult, and as long as the demands on readers’ time, attention, and physical capabilities expand, making it harder and harder for them to perform competently or to stay motivated and self-regulated, then reading devel- opment continues"
"The Science of Reading Finally, let me turn to the very concept around which this special issue of Reading Research Quarterly is framed: the science of reading"
"As someone who has been conducting empirical studies of reading for 40 years, I see the science of reading as contributing to a vast interdisciplinary store of critical information about reading-related skills, processes, antecedents, and out- comes, representing linguistic, cognitive, social, cultural,"
"What Research Has Revealed About Readers’ Struggles With Comprehension in the Digital Age | S91neurological, and psychological dimensions"
"Thus, to see the phrase “science of reading” used in such a limited and pejorative manner is bewildering"
"Regardless of what may appear in the cybersphere, the science of read-ing is not “code for intensive phonics” (Thomas, 2019, para"
"14), except perhaps for those who are intentionally or unintentionally using this phrase to fan the flames of this contentious debate"
"In fact, the very challenges of reading in this digital age that I will highlight have come to light as a result of scientific and interdisciplinary read- ing studies"
"So described, it is essential to understand that it is not the science of reading that is the problem"
"Rather, it is the misrepresentation and even weaponiza- tion of that term to serve some personal, pedagogical, or political agenda"
"Reading Challenges in the Digital Age When I first conceived of this contribution to this special issue on the science of reading, my intention was to widen the vista on the ongoing dispute"
"Specifically, I wanted to call attention to various reading challenges that students now occupying K–20 classrooms are confronting daily"
"I organized these challenges, along with the insights gar- nered from recent research, into three general areas that relate to information saturation, information seeking, and information communication and justification"
"Before I overview these three areas, however, let me first forward an important caveat"
I intend to touch on only a small segment of the vast body of research and the associated literacy con- cerns that have grown exponentially over the past 20 years
The full scope of that literature is far too complex to be covered in this brief commentary
"For those who wish to pursue the subject of digital reading or digital literacy further, there are excellent overviews (e.g., Coiro, 2020; Goldman et al., 2016) and entire volumes (Braasch, Bråten, & McCrudden, 2018; McKenna, Labbo, Kieffer, & Reinking, 2013; Van Meter, List, Lombardi, & Kendeou, 2020) that would be invaluable resources"
Information Saturation The expression “too much of a good thing” accurately captures the world in which students currently live and learn
"They are truly inundated with information from a multitude of sources 24-7 (Pew Research Center, 2019)"
"Paradoxically, even though students are drowning in information, they almost obsessively crave more, and they want that information delivered at lightning speed to their digital devices, which are invariably near at hand, if not in hand (Perrin & Kumar, 2019)"
"Moreover, although these iGens appear hungry for the latest information, they prefer it to come in the form of short pithy texts such as memes and tweets"
"Indeed, many find reading more extended texts, such as textbook chapters, downright painful (Twenge, Martin, & Spitzberg, 2019)"
"Why read a newspaper article, for instance, when you can get news flashes on your phone or computer"
"These students also engage in multitasking, which permits them to attempt several tasks at once but to the detriment of comprehen- sion and overall performance quality (Foehr, 2006;E"
"Similarly, iGens’ frequent use of short-hand in text messages has come to invade their academic writing (C"
"It also appears that elementary, high school, and college stu-dents’ ability to engage in quality discussions is suffering and can benefit significantly from direct intervention (Murphy et al., 2018)"
"In addition, there is evidence that students’ attention spans and their perceptiveness (i.e., awareness of what is occurring in real time around them) is suffering (Graber, 2014; Richtel, 2010)"
"Another noticeable corollary of this new age of information saturation is an orientation toward information management over knowledge build- ing in academic contexts (Alexander, 2018)"
"By that, I mean that today’s students are less likely to engage with school texts for the purpose of retaining what they have learned in perpetuity"
"Instead, students more often report a goal of remembering content just long enough to complete assignments, pass tests, or get good grades"
"Once those goals are met, the content can be purged from memory"
"Another interesting pattern documented across multiple studies is that undergraduate students over- whelmingly prefer to read texts digitally as opposed to in print (Singer & Alexander, 2017), in what Coiro (2020) referred to as digital spaces"
The students also report that their performance on a comprehension test taken immediately after reading is better under the digi-tal than print condition
"Perhaps that sounds logical given that these iGens have come to see themselves as digital natives (Prensky, 2001)"
"Surprisingly, what we have consistently found is that these undergraduates’ comprehension was significantly better when they read in print rather than on a computer (Singer & Alexander, 2017)"
"Others have reported similar outcomes for ele- mentary students, as well (Støle, Mangen, & Schwippert, 2020)"
"One clue to this puzzlement may be that the students in our studies (Singer Trakhman, Alexander, & Berkowitz, 2019) read significantly faster digitally than in print"
"In effect, although there is generally a speed– accuracy tradeoff in performance (Wickelgren, 1977), the students may have mistakenly equated faster pro-cessing with higher proficiency."
"S92 | Reading Research Quarterly, 55(S1)Information Seeking Another familiar instructional activity for students is con- ducting online information searches"
"Although informa- tion searches have long been a staple in teachers’ repertoire, the current conditions have complicated this process for students in multiple ways"
"Those complicating conditions include a universe of digital sources at students’ fingertips that can contain content authored by any person regard- less of expertise or aims (Goodwin, 2020)"
"Further, online information sources cover the spectrum in terms of their forms (e.g., websites, blogs, news articles, research arti- cles) and their credibility (Bråten, Strømsø, & Salmerón, 2011; Coiro, 2020; Coiro, Coscarelli, Maykel, & Forzani, 2015)"
"There is also a surprising amount of online content that is either unintentionally misleading or purposefully deceptive, which can make the information search process a precarious undertaking (Sinatra & Lombardi, 2020)"
"Researchers who investigate online search behaviors have repeatedly reported that students often engage in case building, overrely on search engines to guide their text choices, seem unable to distinguish between more and less credible sources, and struggle with synthesizing and inte- grating content across texts (Bråten et al., 2011; List & Alexander, 2017)"
"Case building means that those who ini- tiate an information search around a controversial topic, such as the science of reading, either consciously or uncon-sciously select sources that reflect their preexisting beliefs, biases, or prejudices (List, Grossnickle, & Alexander, 2016)"
"Thus, instead of using the search as an opportunity to investigate a specific topic with a critical-analytic eye, the process becomes an exercise in supporting and even strengthening one’s existing views"
"What literacy researchers have also found is that even mature and fluent readers’ bases for selecting online sources leave much to be desired (Coiro et al., 2015)"
"For instance, students at every academic level appear overly reliant on Google or other search engines to determine their source selections (List et al., 2016)"
This is evidenced by the fact that students often opt for the first sources that pop up on the search page and rarely bother to look at offerings on page 2 or beyond
Perhaps these behaviors are indicative of some misguided notion that search engines list sources in terms of their relevance or credibility
"In actuality, the algorithms that search engines use to build lists of sources are well-guarded secrets and likely involve factors unrelated to credibility"
"Also, when asked how they select their sources, students’ criteria have included non-epistemic factors such as the length of the text or the catch-iness of titles (Grossnickle Peterson & Alexander, 2020)"
"Information Communication and Justification One unwanted behavior that occurs not only in under- graduates but also in younger and older populations is a tendency to communicate complex, multifaceted, and often contentious issues in overly simplistic, black- or-white terms"
"This orientation leaves no room for any grays, the nuanced or nonextreme iterations that invariably lie between opposing positions"
"The resulting misrepresenta- tion is referred to as a false dichotomy (Gehlbach & Roeser, 2002)"
"Contrasts such as good or poor, effective or ineffec- tive, and appropriate or inappropriate may sound clean and simple on the surface, but they belie the true complex-ity of whatever is being evaluated"
"Literacy researchers have documented such false dichotomies in written arguments that students generated after completing online searches about controversial topics such as the death penalty, corpo-ral punishment, and vaccinations (Bråten et al., 2011)"
"Students’ written arguments more commonly took a strong pro or con stance on the issue and rarely voiced a more nuanced position (Barzilai & Weinstock, 2020)"
The stu-dents’ actions may reflect their perception of argumenta- tion more as convincing others that their position is the only right or just one
"It is interesting to note that this problem of dealing with contentious issues in black-or-white terms is what I encountered in the rhetoric surrounding the “science of reading” controversy (Hanford, 2019)"
"I found certain writings rather polemic, where one side, be it phonics or whole language, was characterized favorably and the other described in unflattering terms"
"This remains the case even though there is ample evidence that few indi-viduals are purists in their instructional approach but instead modulate their teaching depending on an array of learner, text, and contextual factors (Moats, 2019)"
"Of course, positioning oneself in the grays requires the abil-ity to ascertain when, where, or for whom instruction should intentionally lean toward one side of the issue or the other (Pearson, 2004)"
"Other challenges manifest for today’s students when they attempt to consolidate information from various sources into a coherent and well-supported piece of expo- sition or argument (McNamara, Crossley, & McCarthy, 2010)"
"One problem for students in this consolidation process is determining what content is important and relevant enough to be included in the final document (Alexander & Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory [DRLRL], 2012)"
"Also, when addressing a contentious topic, students do not routinely incorporate counterpoints or strong arguments on the other side of the issue from their own (Singh, Sun, & Zhao, 2019)"
"Moreover, I was honestly surprised to find that the high- achieving students, like those in my university class, had little awareness of what it meant to justify whatever claims they made verbally or in writing (Alexander & DRLRL, 2020)"
"They also did not appreciate that their experiences did not constitute good enough evidence for certain kinds of claims (Mason, Boldrin, & Ariasi, 2010)"
"What Research Has Revealed About Readers’ Struggles With Comprehension in the Digital Age | S93(2018) proclaimed in Rhetoric, the pathos that such human-interest stories generate can be powerful tools of persuasion.Y et, the astute readers and listeners recognize that more compelling forms of evidence are warranted before arguments are accepted"
"What is also apparent is that even skilled adult read- ers can find themselves swayed by pathos and can find it difficult to justify claims with viable text-based evi-dence (Alexander & DRLRL, 2012)"
The reliance on personal experiences over solid research evidence is sadly far too common and not just in students’ writings
"If one looks at some of the writings populating social media on the science of reading, you will encounter such personal stories used in support of one side of the phonics or whole language debate or the other"
"As Goodwin (2020) rightly observed, the voices of this controversy are more often bloggers, journalists, par- ents, or teachers sharing their personal experiences on both sides of this debate"
"In contrast, as Goodwin noted, members of the reading research community had appeared less willing to enter into the public discourse pertaining to the science of reading"
"This is the case even for those whose work could serve as viable coun- terpoints to some of the weakly evidenced proclama- tions that have been communicated via social media, where credibility seems more dependent on the num-ber of retweets, likes, or followers than on the quality of the empirical data gathered"
"As I stated at the outset of this article, I contend that it is imperative to expand the conception of reading that pop- ulates current discourse on the “science of reading” debate"
It is also critical to recognize that reading develop-ment carries well beyond the primary grades and long after young learners have broken the linguistic code
"Moreover, concerned parties cannot turn a blind eye to the serious challenges that today’s students face on a daily basis—challenges that call for interdisciplinary inquiry and meaningful collaborations among teachers, research- ers, parents, and policymakers"
"I briefly overviewed sev-eral reading challenges that can be ascribed, in part, to this digital age in which we live"
"The good news is that those potential barriers that I described regarding infor- mation saturation, information seeking, and information communication and justification are by no means insur- mountable obstacles to optimal reading development for all students"
"In fact, there is much that researchers, teachers, school administrators, parents, policymakers, and stu- dents themselves can do to maximize the literacy benefits accrued from the multitude of online and offline technol-ogies that exist both in and out of school"
"Here, I offer a few instructional guidelines shown to be effective in deal-ing with the challenges of reading in the digital age"
• Draw on students’ personal interests and experi-ences as the foundation for instruction
• Foster student interactions and collaborations around meaningful problems using diverse text medi ums and genres
"Draw on Students’ Personal Interests and Experiences One principle that has been demonstrated in the research for more than a century is that personal interest can be a powerful, driving force in what students learn and what they do (Alexander, 2005; Dewey, 1903, 1913)"
"When stu-dents are truly invested in the content or processes being taught, they learn more easily, acquire a deeper and richer understanding, and retain the knowledge longer than when they perceive the content as abstract, esoteric, or unrelated to their lives or personal identities (Hidi, 2001; Moje & Luke, 2009)"
That principle was repeatedly illus-trated in informative case studies of effective learning environments that Ito et al
(2013) compiled in their Connected Learning: An Agenda for Research and Design report
"The instructional implication of this principle is that teachers must help students recognize their personal con-nection to the texts being read or the activities in which they are embedded (Hattan, 2019; Moje & Luke, 2009)"
"In effect, educators need to attend to elements of a poem, story, or subject matter text that are potentially relevant to students, reflect their interests, or mirror experiences in their own lives"
This principle should not be miscon- strued to mean that teachers should dress up the content to make it more enticing or palpable to students
"Such momentary piquing of interest, called situational interest, can be detrimental to deeper and more enduring learning (Schiefele, 1999)"
"As Dewey (1913) warned, such an approach “implies the same divorce between object and self"
"When things have to be made interesting, it is because interest itself is wanting” (p"
Guide Students Toward the Smart Use of Smart Technologies I do not want to leave the impression that digital technol- ogies are inherently the enemies of reading or reading development
"Technology is an integral part of the networked lives that we live (Leu et al., 2015)"
"Moreover, today’s technologies are equipped with an array of tools not available in the print-only world that can facilitate students’ reading and learning from texts, including apps for annotation and translation,"
"S94 | Reading Research Quarterly, 55(S1)digital glossaries, and tools for collaborating (Dalton & Palincsar, 2013)"
"My objections pertain to the mindless, unregulated, and passive use of such technological tools both in and out of school (Alexander, 2018)"
"Mindful use of technology is not solely an issue for students, however (Forzani, 2018)"
"Teachers, too, should be cognizant of when and why to employ technologies during reading instruction or when content-based instruction involves text"
"Parents can assist in this regard, as well, by creating guidelines on when, where, and for how long their chil- dren are online (Alexander & Singer Trakhman, 2017)"
"Moreover, teachers should help students acquire strategies for engaging with digital texts in a manner that fosters rather than thwarts their comprehension (Alexander & DRLRL, 2012; Cho & Afflerbach, 2015)"
"Strategies that have been found to be effective include reading digital texts more slowly, periodically stopping to reflect on or ask questions about what was read, anno-tating digital texts, or writing down key points or ques- tions on paper (Cho & Afflerbach, 2017; Singer Trakhman, 2019)"
"It may seem ridiculous to teach stu-dents who have grown up with digital technologies how to engage them more effectively, but in actuality, stu- dents are not always the savvy digital natives we think them to be (Coiro, 2012; Forzani, 2018; Ng, 2012)"
"It is true that students have a wealth of knowledge about maneuvering in hyperspace and about the latest tech features and apps, but they still require instruction that focuses on locating, evaluating, synthesizing, integrat- ing, and communicating digital information (Bråten et al., 2011; Leu et al., 2015)"
"They also need help to recog-nize biased, inaccurate, and prejudicial sources written to mislead them (Sinatra & Lombardi, 2020)"
"Foster Interactions and Collaborations With Diverse Texts and Meaningful Activities Finally, one of the advantages of living in this digital age is the wealth of written language that is literally at our finger- tips"
Entire libraries of texts exist for almost any subject one may wish to explore
"Further, those texts are not lim-ited to the standard canon to which many adults were exposed (Moje & Luke, 2009)"
"Instead, they cover the spectrum in terms of time, domain, culture, mediums, and genre"
Students should be able to locate appropriate texts to match whatever interests or purposes they have for reading
"This diversity of texts can be individually read and relished for entirely personal reasons or can become part of collaborative learning activities carried out in and out of school (Ito et al., 2013)"
"Such freedom allows stu-dents to identify with the people, places, and experiences described in texts"
It allows students to explore cultures other than their own and other times and places than those they know more intimately
"Such breadth and diversity of texts can empower students to acquire infor- mation needed to tackle complex or controversial issues and real-world problems of importance to them or their communities (Jeong, & Hmelo-Silver, 2010)"
"When the universe of relevant and appropriate texts is made available to students, under the guidance and with the support of teachers and parents, the motivation to engage with written language can grow (Wigfield, Gladstone, & Turci, 2016)"
"In addition, students demon- strate more commitment to building knowledge than to simply managing information to get by or to do only what is required (Alexander, 2018)"
"There can be more personal value placed on reading and more emotional investment in the knowledge and abilities gained from reading (Stutz, Schaffner, & Schiefele, 2016)"
(2013) described not only pertains to shared literacy experiences among students but also can manifest between parents and their children or as a private and deeply personal experience between reader and text
"Concluding Thoughts What I have set out to accomplish in this critique is to reorient the current controversy over the science of read- ing by broadening the conceptions of reading, reading development, and the science of reading that presently dominate that debate"
I have drawn on reading research from multiple disciplines to make the case that reading is an expansive activity that occurs whenever a person and written language interact
I have also sought to widen the parameters regarding what constitutes texts within this digital age
"Further, I have argued for a conception of reading development that extends far beyond the primary grades and the initial stages of learning to read"
This alter- native view conveys reading development as a lifelong process of growth and transformation
"Finally, I set out to demonstrate that an overly constrained perception of reading and reading development comes with serious consequences, including a disregard of challenges faced by students living and learning in this digital age"
"The sci-entific study of reading in its many manifestations has been crucial in bringing such challenges to light and in offering guidance for addressing them, too"
I shared sev- eral recommendations found to circumvent or ameliorate such challenges for younger and older students represent-ing a diversity of interests and backgrounds
"What conceptions of reading, reading development, and the science of reading emerge in the decades to come I cannot say"
"However, what remains clear is that stu-dents, then as now, cannot be expected to deal with those reading-related challenges without the insights garnered from the research, without the instructional guidance and support of knowledgeable teachers, and without the"
