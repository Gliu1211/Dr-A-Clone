"biological fact is combined with the realization that the lives humans experience are equally idiosyncratic, the story of human uniqueness becomes extremely complicated.Individual differences are the term for the systematic investigation of human similarities and differences, and the study of human similarities and differences remains a cornerstone in educational psychology and educational assessment (Jonassen & Crabowski, 2011)"
"Sir Francis Galton (1869) is the individual most often credited with turning humans’ fascination with uniqueness into the science of individual differences when he set out totest whether the frequent occurrence of eminence (i.e., exceptional mental ability) withincertain families was inherited"
"Borrowing a technique that a Belgian astronomer, Qu /C19etelet, used to track patterns in astronomic observations, Galton summarized thousands ofmeasurements and found what is commonly described as the bell curve"
"In this way, helaid the groundwork for how we think about the ‘normal distribution’ of human characteristics (Alexander, 2006)"
Galton is also credited with introducing the mathe- matical concepts of correlation and regression into the lexicon
"However, it fell to KarlPearson (1895), his collaborator, to provide the mathematics required for correlationalanalyses; the way to ascertain the association that exists between characteristics orvariables"
"Ultimately, this historical sojourn reminds us that the science of individual differencesentails the systematic study of human typicality and atypicality for an indeﬁnite number ofcognitive and non-cognitive characteristics (Ackerman, 1988; Guilford, 1956)"
"It also reinforces the notion that this science is intricately intertwined with assessment (Adams, 2014; Cronbach, 1956; Spearman, 1927)"
"In accordance with the aims of this Special Issue (Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia & Shavelson, this issue), my goal is to look at the topic of individual differences and assessment from theperspective of young adult learners"
"With the literature on adult differences as thebackdrop, I overview research in which my colleagues and I have been engaged"
"Thisresearch establishes an association between younger and older adults’ domain-speciﬁclearning and performance (Alexander, 1997, 2003) and their ability to discern meaningful relations within seemingly unrelated information (Alexander, Dumas, Grossnickle, List, & Firetto, 2016)"
"Mapping the neurobiological and cognitive landscape for college-aged learners One does not have to be an expert in individual differences to recognize that with age comes marked changes in how humans look, think, and behave"
One needs only tocompare healthy 2-year-olds to 20-year-olds to see the effects of time on the humanspecies
"Yet, some of the more signiﬁcant developments that occur in the ﬁrst decades oflife and in the decades that follow are not visible to the naked eye"
"They are the transformations occurring within the hardware (i.e., neuroanatomy) and software (i.e., neurophysiology) of the human mind"
"Moreover, with changes in the brain’s architecturecome concomitant changes in cognitive, psychological, and socioemotional processesthat impact college students’ learning and performance"
"Neurobiological changes Much attention is paid to children’s, cognitive, biological, and socioemotional develop- ment (Bjorklund & Causey, 2017)"
transformations that occur in the way that young children think and behave
"Similarly, early adolescence is a period of dramatic change, as any parent of 10 –16 years old can attest"
"However, the cognitive, behavioural, social, and emotional transformations takingplace among college students are particularly vital to their ability to be independent and goal-directed and, ultimately, successful in their future endeavours (Ackerman, 2000)"
The shifts of particular importance here are situated in two types of brain matter that makeup human’s central nervous system (CNS) –the control centre for all human functions that consists of our brain and spinal cord
"That CNS is composed of grey matter (GM) and whitematter (WM), which serve different roles in human thoughts, behaviours, and emotions.GM contains the brain’s neuronal elements (cell bodies, dendrites, axon terminals, andsynapses), while the WM consists of axon bundles covered in myelin"
The principal job ofWM is conducting nerve signals up and down the spinal cord
"WM makes up the bulk of the deep parts of the brain, what Newman (2017) called ‘the brain’s ﬂexible but underrated superhighway.’ From childhood to early adulthood, there is a decrease in GM and a corresponding increase in WM (Sowell, Thompson, Tessner, & Toga, 2001)"
"In fact, the frontal regions ofthe cerebral cortex associated with higher-level executive functions are the last toundergo myelination (Fields, 2010)"
"With this increase in WM comes greater neurologicalefﬁciency and enhanced capacity to engage in more complex, higher-order cognitivefunctions (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006)"
It is important to recognize that this neurological shift comes just as college students begin making crucial decisions about academic and career paths
"Thus, they seem neurologically and cognitively betterequipped to build the knowledge, interests, and problem-solving skills required toachieve future goals"
"Thankfully, what college students begin to lose in speededperformance, attention, or working memory, they gain in cognitive ﬂexibility, reasoning,and decision-making (Ackerman, Beier, & Boyle, 2002)"
"Executive function and academic development As noted, the neurobiological transformations during this period allow for higher-levelmental processing and control, referred to as executive function or EF (Diamond, 2013).EF encompasses humans’ ability to act intentionally, reﬂect on ideas, recognize and weighalternatives, understand consequences, control emotion responses, make reasoneddecisions, stay focused, set future goals, and be generally stable yet ﬂexible (Jurado &Rosselli, 2007; McGivern, Andersen, Byrd, Mutter, & Reilly, 2002; Taylor, Barker, Heavey,& McHale, 2013)"
Such characteristics are valued for college students working to succeed in their studies and to do well in career pursuits
"Indeed, ‘examination of the literature on executive function leaves little doubt this domain of cognitive control and behaviouralregulation is involved in numerous aspects of academics and everyday life’ (Baggetta &Alexander, 2016;p"
"Also, there is the expectation that college students are increasingly more aware of their speciﬁc cognitive, psychological, social, and emotional strengths and have careeraspirations matched to those strengths (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994)"
"Reﬂecting onthese abilities and interests, students can decide on their programme of study and work towards whatever career goals they envision"
"Such actions are foundational to the development of expertise in speciﬁc ﬁelds of study (Ackerman, 2003; Alexander, 1997,2018)"
"As a consequence, EFs can manifest differently when measured in students’domains of study rather than generically (Romine & Reynolds, 2005)"
"Speciﬁcally, withthe increased domain-speciﬁc knowledge, interest, and problem-solving abilities that418 Patricia A"
"accompany expertise development, students can deepen their thinking and reﬂection, inform their decision-making, increase their focus, and exhibit more cognitive ﬂexibilityin that domain (Ackerman, 2000; Alexander, 2003; Ericsson, 2004)"
"The three moststudied EFs are working memory, inhibitory control, and relational reasoning"
"Relational reasoning as a crucial executive function Relational reasoning (RR) can be deﬁned as individuals’ ability to notice and attend to critical similarities and differences in what, on the surface, appear to be unrelatedinformation or data (Alexander, Singer, Jablansky, & Hattan, 2016; Alexander, Dumas, et al"
These perceived relations further coalesce into meaningful patterns that guide thinking and action
"In effect, RR is the ability to perceive deep and relevantassociations where they do not obviously exist"
"For the past decade, our research team hasbeen investigating nature, manifestations, assessment, and malleability of RR"
"As othersbefore us (Cattell, 1940; Spearman, 1927), we regard this higher-order executive functionas a deﬁning difference in human cognition and development, and important to assessgenerally and domain-speciﬁcally"
"From our extensive work, we have garnered insightsinto RR that have bearing on college students’ learning and performance and into issues of assessment"
The nature and forms of relational reasoning My colleagues and I are by no means the ﬁrst to recognize the power of relationalreasoning
"Spearman (1927), for one, considered reasoning by relations as the sine qua non for human cognitive ability, and his belief shaped the work of his students, Cattell (1940) and Raven (1941), who created intelligence tests around reasoning about complex relations"
"In fact, within cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, the Raven’s Progressive Matrices is still regarded as the gold standard for assessing this executivefunction (Dumas, Alexander, & Grossnickle, 2013)"
"While our deﬁnition of RR isconsistent with the research in cognitive neuroscience, we broadened its conceptual-ization to encompass not only the ability to recognize similarities (i.e., analogicalreasoning), but also the dissimilarities"
"This effort to unearth reasoning patternspredicated on dissimilarities was informed by writings in intelligence, higher-orderthinking, and mathematics set theory (Cattell, 1940; Russell, 1903; Spearman, 1927)"
"Ultimately, three distinct forms representing varied patterns of dissimilarities were identiﬁed as follows: anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis (Alexander, Dumas, et al"
"Sample items from the Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR; Alexander & the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory [DRLRL],2012) help to explain these forms (see Figure 1)"
"The TORR is a ﬂuid measure of RRcreated for older adolescents and adults, which means it measures the ability to applyreasoning to a novel rather than a ‘schooled’ problem"
"It consists of 32 ﬁgural itemsorganized in four 8-item scales, one for each form"
"Of the aforementioned forms, analogical reasoning is the most familiar and involves the process of discerning similarities across objects, ideas, and experiences that areseemingly unrelated"
"As shown in Figure 1a, respondents must recognize the systematicchanges in shape and number occurring within rows and columns in the array in order toselect the missing piece from the options shown"
"As with the Raven’s (1941), all items inthis scale are conﬁgured as matrices"
"Anomalous reasoning , by comparison, is theIndividual differences in college-age learners 419"
"process of identifying a discrepant case or outlier within a set of objects, ideas, or experiences"
"For problem 1b, the set consists of ﬁgures composed of horizontal andvertical lines"
"In this problem, there is a particular ratio of horizontal to vertical linescommon to all but one member –the anomaly"
"Antinomous reasoning is the process of reaching a categorical judgment as to whether an object, idea, or experience can or cannot be a member of a given set of objects, ideas, orexperiences"
"To illustrate, theantinomy item (Figure 1c) requires respondents to determine which of the option setscan have no members in common with the given"
"Finally, for antithetical reasoning , the judgment to be made is not categorical but one of contrasts or opposition"
"Thus, inFigure 1d, respondents must discern the pattern of change represented in the given problem"
"Over the course of multiple studies, the TORR has been shown to be a psychome- trically sound measure"
"(Details on the TORR, including item difﬁculties, intercorrela-tions, reliability coefﬁcients, invariance testing, and the resulting factor structure are Figure 1"
Sample items from the Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR) from the scales for (a) analogical reasoning; (b) anomalous reasoning; (c) antinomous reasoning; and (d) antithetical reasoning.420 Patricia A
"Even more importantly for this Special Issue, the TORR has been found to predict older adolescents’ and adults’ performance on a variety ofdemanding cognitive tasks including writing an argumentative essay (Singh, Sun, & Zhao,2018), developing creative solutions to engineering design problems (Dumas, Schmidt, & Alexander, 2016; Jablansky, Alexander, & Schmidt, 2018), and thinking critically about maternity patients’ care (Fountain, 2016)"
"Although not the focus of this article, twoadditional measures of RR have been developed and validated: the Verbal Test ofRelational Reasoning (vTORR, Alexander, Singer, et al"
", 2016) for adolescents and adults; and the Test of Relational Reasoning-Junior (TORRjr; Alexander & the DRLRL, 2015) forchildren and younger adolescents"
"While I have illustrated the forms of RR with sample items from TORR, it should be understood that these forms have been documented in everyday discourse and group problem solving"
"For instance, all four forms were evident in the verbalizations of mathematics and science teachers, undergraduate engineering students working on adesign task, and residents and their attending physician diagnosing patients’ conditions(Dumas, Alexander, Baker, Jablansky, & Dunbar, 2014; Jablansky et al"
Signiﬁcance for adult learning and performance What has this decade of research into relational reasoning revealed about adult differences and assessment methods that addresse the goals of this Special Issue
"Here, we shareinsights that speak to between- and within-group ﬁndings, developmental and domaindifferences, as well as the co-occurrence of forms during problem solving"
"Between- and within-group differences In validating the TORR, Dumas and Alexander (2016) determined that relational reasoning is normally distributed among older adolescents and adults, but that total score does not tell the whole story"
"While most individuals scoring in the upper ranges of the test wereconsistently strong across all scales and those markedly below average were consistentlyweak, there was noticeable variability for those in the mid-ranges"
"For example, the sametotal score was achieved by students who scored moderately on each scale, as well asthose who were high on one or two scales but low on the others"
"In effect, the speciﬁcscales of the TORR were informative sources of individual variability"
"Also, theinvestigation of differential item functioning for various groups (Dumas & Alexander, 2018, np) showed that the TORR was not only structurally invariant, but also could be ‘meaningfully calibrated, normed, and scored in adolescent and adult populations likethose enrolled in higher education, without explicitly accounting for the demographicgroup membership’ (i.e., gender, race, and ethnicity)"
"Developmental, task, and domain differences Developmentally, there is evidence of relevant changes in relational reasoning over time (Jablansky, Alexander, Dumas, & Compton, 2016)"
"found that even kindergartens were capable of reasoning analogically, anomalously, antithetically,and antinomously when presented in a familiar problem-solving task"
"What was particularly striking was the differentialreliance on various forms between the early grades (Kindergarten, second, and fourth)Individual differences in college-age learners 421"
"Speciﬁcally, there was strong reliance on analogies and antitheses and minimal evidence of anomalies and antinomies among theyounger students"
"In contrast, older students voiced more anomalies and antinomies,and very few analogies and antitheses during task performance"
"In light of this evidence, we tentatively concluded that certain forms of RR may be later developing than others"
"However, there are intervening factors that come into play, most notablytask or content familiarity"
"To be more precise, when the ‘technological’ object the younger children were manipulating was familiar (e.g., juice box), their RR was more sophisticated than whenthe object was novel (e.g., an unusual vegetable cutter)"
"Older students, by comparison,engaged in more frequent and more sophisticated RR when the object was novel"
Thissuggests that the features of the problem should be taken into consideration when measuring RR
"Should a given task be too commonplace or too simple, then there seemingly little need to reasoning relationally"
"Conversely, when a task is highly complexand novel, then perhaps even adult learners may not be able to reason at an optimal level"
The malleability of relational reasoning The prior discussion raises the question as to whether RR is malleable
Can explicittraining delivered generically or domain-speciﬁcally alter the developmental trajectory for RR
There are certain data that can shed some light on the malleability of this higher-order executive function
"For one, my colleaguesand I have been successful at training analogical reasoning in children and adolescentswithin the context of reading, history, or human biology instruction (Alexander, Pate,Kulikowich, Farrell, & Wright, 1989; White & Alexander, 1986)"
"Let me also state that I see no value in training RR by means of abstract, decontextualized problems like those on the TORR for two reasons"
"For one, the history of generic problem-solving programmes is not encouraging (Wagner & Sternberg, 1984)"
"For another, the value of assessments like the TORR lies in their novelty and abstraction, sotraining to the test would be counterproductive and ill-advised"
"Rather, training shouldfocus on nature of the forms as they manifest in different academic domains and theunderlying processes they entail"
"In the past, my colleagues and I used Sternberg’s (1977)componential processes (i.e., encoding, inferring, mapping, and applying) to trainanalogical reasoning (Alexander et al"
"Using Bayesian network analysis, Gross- nickle, Dumas, Alexander, and Baggetta (2016) found that these same componential processes –especially inferring and mapping –distinguished high-performing from low- performing students on the TORR"
"There have been two recent studies that involved training the forms of relational reasoning, although the results were mixed"
"There were quite positive outcomes for anintervention Hattan (2018) conducted in language arts classrooms serving a rural,economically disadvantaged community"
The middle-school students were trained inthe forms of RR as a way to improve their comprehension and recall of expositorytexts
"Students were taught to pose questions representing each form before, during, and after reading as a way to relate the unfamiliar content (i.e., Ancient Greece and Rome) to their own lives and experiences"
"For example, the students were asked toconsider how something in the reading reminded them of their own lives (analogy) orcould never be true in their lives (antinomy)"
"This approach was compared to aknowledge mobilization technique (i.e., ‘tell me what you know’), and a control (text422 Patricia A"
The effectiveness of the relational reasoning approach over the other treatment and control conditions was demonstrated on immediate and delayedcomprehension assessments
"In contrast, two Israeli researchers taught the four forms as a way to enhance eighth graders’ understanding of key physics concepts (Aharon & Eilam, 2018)"
The training involved 16 90-min lessons where students learned the RR forms using examples fromtheir everyday lives
"Then, the four forms were used as the physics content (e.g.,acceleration and velocity) was taught"
"To assess the effectiveness of the intervention,the eighth graders took a researcher-developed measure that required students toidentify and explain the similarities and differences between two types of motion beingdepicted (e.g., constant velocity and constant acceleration)"
"The repeated-measuresanalysis showed no signiﬁcant difference between treatment and control classes on this measure, suggesting that the intervention did not improve students’ learning of physics"
The researchers concluded that the students’ struggle to deal both with thenovelty of RR and the unfamiliar and challenging physics content may simply havebeen too much
"The interplay among relation reasoning forms Finally, I want to share one other signiﬁcant ﬁnding; the orchestrated ways in which the forms of RR work in concert"
"In those situations where we have examined RR as it occurs naturally among individuals jointly engaged in problem solving, one fact has becomeapparent"
"The forms do not function in isolation, but unfold in a systematic, almostrhythmic manner set in motion by the task at hand"
"We witnessed this with the residentsand attending physicians diagnosing patients’ conditions and determining appropriatetreatment, a science teacher trying to instruct her students about weather patterns, andthe engineering students coming up with a viable design for their senior project (Dumaset al"
One particular form of reasoning utterance was predictably followed by another (see Dumas et al
", 2014 for an detailed example of the pattern among medical doctors)"
"Collectively, these studies are critical reminders that the forms of RR arenot only important singularly in problem solving, but also collectively"
Conclusion and implications What can those interested in individual differences among higher education students andtheir assessment garner from this overview I have offered
"For one, in light ofneurobiological and cognitive transformations students of this age are undergoing,higher education is an opportune time to gather crucial data about college students’capabilities to think and reason relationally"
It is also a time to build on those capacities byconsciously embedding the language and processes of reasoning relationally ininstruction and in assessments of learning and performance
"In this way, I concur withBl€omeke, Gustafsson, and Shavelson’s (2015) conception of a competence continuum that encompasses not only underlying capacities but also the manifestation of those capacities in performance of complex, real-world problems"
"In effect, as a foundationalcognitive ability that remains critical to learning and performance throughout formaleducation and beyond, relational reasoning should have an acknowledged the presencewithin that continuum"
"As a starting point, the TORR could be administered early incollege, arming students with knowledge about their capabilities to perceive meaningfulIndividual differences in college-age learners 423"
"What matters next, of course, is how those capabilities are enacted, reﬁned, and reinforced in instruction"
"As I have argued (Alexander, 2003), the trajectory that leads to competence and potentially expertise in any ﬁeld of study requires individuals to forge principled knowledge –signiﬁcant understandings representing complex interrelations of concep- tual and procedural information encountered in diverse contexts and at varied times.Those progressing on the path to expertise must also recognize when and where to applyto problem-solving skills they have been taught"
"For that reason, through the instructionthey receive, these students should be made aware of how the forms RR manifest in theirspeciﬁc ﬁeld of study (e.g., how an anomaly in astronomy differs from an anomaly inmedical practice)"
"Moreover, they should recognize how those forms can assist them inforging connections among the content and topics to which they are exposed"
"Additionally, those responsible for providing young adults with a meaningful education should model those reasoning process in their teaching and build them into theirassessments"
"Rather than being inundated with overly simplistic, one-dimensionalquestions, students routinely should be required to demonstrate a deeper understandingof learned content by making critical comparisons, noting discrepancies, offeringcounterarguments, or perceiving contradictions"
"Regardless of the quality of the education experienced, its value will be signiﬁcantly limited unless college students can recognize how academic content relates to what they experience in the outside world"
"The question remains whether students will be able to see how ideas, problems, or experiences encountered in the everyday life –and consequently messier, less stylized, and less familiar than those upon which they areschooled –are nonetheless occasions for transfer"
"Therefore, as part of the competence continuum, I see a place for performance assessments that draw on RR nested withincomplex, domain-speciﬁc, real-world problems, such as those devised by Shavelson,Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, and Mari ~no (2018)"
"Through such assessments, there is the opportunity to acquire valuable information on outcomes reﬂecting competence and rich data on the reasoning processes leading to those outcomes"
"Of course, I am aware of the barriers that exist to higher education’s embrace of RR in assessment and instructional practices"
"I am arguing for RR just at the time whenanalogies, the one form of RR that has had a presence on well-known assessments (e.g.,SAT and GRE), have been excised in favour of text-based questions"
"There is also the realitythat the other forms of RR are relatively unfamiliar to most students, educators,educational researchers, and even some assessment experts"
"Further, constructing eitherﬂuid or crystallized items for these less familiar forms, especially antinomies and antitheses, can be daunting tasks"
"Yet, unlike the verbal analogies on the SAT or GRE, the items on the TORR are non- verbal and novel and found to be culturally-fair (Dumas & Alexander, 2018)"
"More to thepoint, our research has documented that these forms manifest when individuals andgroups engage in complex problem solving and are predictive of performance (Dumaset al"
"It would seem, therefore, that if students, educators, educational researchers, and assessment experts remain in the dark about the nature and importanceof relational reasoning, they cannot adequately harness whatever potential this ability holds for college-age learners"
"I appreciate the incalculable differences that distinguish one human from another, and recognize that differences continue to manifest within higher education"
"Nonetheless, Imaintain that the competence young adults manifest in their ability to perceivemeaningful relations within all they see, hear, or experience will remain crucial to their424 Patricia A"
