"fpsyg-12-630609 March 2, 2021 Time: 12:20 # 2 Chae and Alexander Changes in Relational Reasoning shown that relational reasoning is evident in activities that entail both formal and informal learning (Galotti, 1989; Barwise, 1993) and manifests in such disciplines as medicine (Greenwood and King, 1995), engineering (Murphy et al., 2017), science and mathematics (Alexander, 2017; Resnick et al., 2017), reading (Kendeou et al., 2017), and writing (Egyed, 2010)"
"There is a growing interest in relational reasoning, fueled in part by contemporary research in cognitive neuroscience (Baggetta and Alexander, 2016; Wertheim and Ragni, 2018; Gray and Holyoak, 2020) and in educational and cognitive psychology (e.g., Grossnickle et al., 2016; Jablansky et al., 2019)"
"However, recognition of its importance goes back decades to work by James (1890), Spearman (1927), Cattell (1949), and others"
"For example, in his Principles of Psychology , William James (1890) described the ability to discriminate diﬀerences and similarities as essential to human thinking and learning"
Pattern recognition was also central to Cattell (1949) Culture Free Intelligence Test
"Given the weight of the contemporary and historical evidence documenting the signiﬁcance of relational reasoning to cognitive performance, it is justiﬁed to investigate the initial manifestation of relational reasoning and how it develops over time"
"Indeed, questions about relational reasoning have garnered attention in the research of both children (Goswami, 1989, 2013; Richland et al., 2006; Jablansky et al., 2016) and adults (Alexander et al., 1989; Holyoak, 2012)"
"The resulting body of research has aﬀorded insights into when relational reasoning emerges and how it changes over the lifespan (Diamond, 2006, 2013)"
"Still, signiﬁcant gaps in theory and research on the course of relational reasoning development remain"
"With regard to onset, for instance, there is evidence that even children as young as four can manifest relational reasoning when the conditions and contexts are facilitative (White and Alexander, 1986; Chiu and Alexander, 2014)"
"Those facilitative conditions include familiarity with the content or task, scaﬀolding or feedback from a teacher or more knowledgeable other, and a task environment that is interesting and motivating (Marzolf et al., 1999)"
"However, in the aforementioned studies, only one form of relational reasoning was investigated, analogical reasoning, which pertains to the discernment of associations based on similarities"
"Test of Relational Reasoning-Junior In recent years, eﬀorts have been made into the development of ﬂuid measures of relational reasoning that go beyond analogical reasoning"
"For one, Alexander and The Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory (2012) set out to create a ﬂuid measure that assessed analogical, anomalous, antinomous, and antithetical reasoning in ﬁgural form"
"According to this investigation, analogical reasoning signiﬁes recognition of similarities among objects or information"
Anomalous reasoning is an ability to detect an exceptional case in certain groups of objects
"With antinomous reasoning ability, one can identify paradoxical situation necessitating acceptance of two or more ideas that appear contradictory"
Antithetical reasoning means an ability to detect exact opposite of a certain procedure or a concept
"As a result of the extended conceptualization of relational reasoning, the DRLRL developed the Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR), a 32-item measure consisting of four 8-itemscales, each targeting one form of relational reasoning"
"Although normed and standardized on adolescent and adult samples in the United States, the TORR has been administered globally, including in Israel (Aharon and Eilam, 2019) and Russia (Federiakin and Aleksandrova, 2017), with similar outcomes in terms of factor structure, reliabilities, and item functioning"
"This suggests that the examination of relational reasoning, at least by means of ﬂuid measures like the TORRjr, may be less susceptible to cultural diﬀerences"
"Of course, more research on the eﬀects of social and cultural factors on relational reasoning is required"
"While the TORR ﬁlls the need for an alternative measure that captures the multiple manifestations of relational reasoning of adolescents and adults, it does not address the assessment needs for a younger population"
"For that reason, Alexander and the DRLRL created Test of Relational Reasoning-Junior or TORRjr, a parallel but easier version of the TORR that was speciﬁcally for elementary and middle-school students (approximately grades 3 to 7)"
"Earlier versions of the TORRjr, have been administered to elementary- and middle-school students in the United States, New Zealand, and Israel (Alexander and Jablansky, 2017; Jablansky et al., 2017)"
"The ﬁnal version of the TORRjr was recently validated and standardized using data from 790 Chinese students in grades 3 to 7 (Zhao et al., 2020)"
"Changes in Relational Reasoning Over the Lifespan Based on more limited research (Jablansky et al., 2016, 2019), the developmental trajectory for the multiple forms of relational reasoning appears to vary over time"
"For one, they conducted a longitudinal study based on the frequency of students’ relational reasoning utterances when explaining the design and “ﬁt for purpose” of both familiar and novel technological devices (i.e., juice box and vegetable cutter)"
"Participants were a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of 61 New Zealand primary and secondary students, divided into three grade groups: early (pre-kindergarten through second), middle (fourth through eighth), and late (tenth through eleventh)"
Results indicated that children as young as 5 years old were capable of using all 4 forms of relational reasoning in discourse
"(2016, 2019) found that analogical reasoning and anomalous reasoning utterances (i.e., the recognition of aberrance) were dominant in the problem solving of the younger students (ages 5 to 10), than antinomous reasoning (i.e., determinations of exclusivity) and antithetical reasoning (i.e., discernment of opposition)"
"However, antinomous and antithetical reasoning were more likely to be present in the utterances of 15- to 17-year- olds’ problem solving"
"In contrast, in their developmental study involving 148 females, ages 7 to 30, Dumontheil et al"
(2010) reported a dip in relational reasoning development in an otherwise linear growth trajectory during mid-adolescence
"(2016) involved both males and females and focused on the four forms of relational reasoning (i.e., analogy, antinomy, antinomy, and antithesis)"
"Indeed, what might account for the diﬀerential patterns for the distinct forms Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 630609"
"fpsyg-12-630609 March 2, 2021 Time: 12:20 # 3 Chae and Alexander Changes in Relational Reasoning of relational reasoning over time remains an open question"
"Nonetheless, we would hypothesize that these varied patterns for the forms of relational reasoning by age groups could reﬂect greater familiarity for analogy and anomaly than antinomy and antithesis, as well as the process required to discern and then map the pattern associated with true categorical distinctions (antinomies) vs"
"Research Gaps Despite the existent literature on the onset and lifespan changes of relational reasoning to date, several gaps in the extant knowledge remain to be addressed"
"For one, relational reasoning is broadly conceptualized to include relations based on similarities and dissimilarities (James, 1890; Cattell, 1949; Alexander et al., 2016)"
"As noted, most relational reasoning studies have measured or observed only analogical reasoning (e.g., McGivern et al., 2002; Richland et al., 2006)"
"Thus, many of the conclusions that researchers have reached about relational reasoning are most often solely about analogical reasoning and overlook other forms of relational reasoning that deal with dissimilarities, which may be more cognitively demanding"
"Moreover, one research gap in understanding persis around relational reasoning is the paucity of sound measures or experimental tasks that allow for its full assessment, particularly in culturally diverse populations"
"For instance, in cognitive science and neuroscience (Thibaut et al., 2010; Dumas et al., 2014), the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven, 2003), which is a ﬂuid measure of cognitive ability, remains the gold standard for relational reasoning assessment"
"By deﬁnition, a ﬂuid assessment is a novel and typically nonlinguistic measure for which all necessary information for solution is contained in the problem; thus making it more culturally fair than crystallized intelligence tests containing culturally speciﬁc information (Kidd, 1962)"
"The ﬁgural test forms in Raven’s Matrices do not necessitate knowledge acquired through formal schooling in any particular country or culture (Sternberg and Grigorenko, 2006)"
"Despite its frequent use, there are shortcomings to the Raven’s as a measure of relational reasoning"
"Thus, while novel and more culturally fair, the Raven’s is constructed entirely of matrix analogy problems"
"Also, the brain activities of individuals solving select Raven’s items are typically registered by neuroimaging techniques (e.g., Dumontheil et al., 2010; Wertheim and Ragni, 2018; Gray and Holyoak, 2020)"
"The expertise, funds, and facilities that these neuroimaging techniques require render them impractical for more pedestrian and widespread use in relational reasoning research"
"In addition, the appropriateness of these neuroimaging techniques for assessing the thinking and reasoning of young children is debatable due to their potential harm to mental health (Burke, 1958; Mills and Tissot, 1995)"
Capturing brain activities using neuroimaging techniques can be another way to investigate relational reasoning although this methodology is known economically ineﬃcient and clinically harmful
Others invested in researching the onset and changes in relational reasoning have employed alternative measurementtools
"Along with more traditional verbal and ﬁgural analogy tests (e.g., Miller Analogy Test; Murray, 1979), these alternatives have included reasoning problems cast as scenarios or stories or have positioned relational reasoning assessment in a game- playing context (Gick and Holyoak, 1980; Alexander et al., 1986; Chen, 1996; Goswami, 2013)"
"When only analogical reasoning is assessed and when the measures are linguistic in nature, then the ability to uncover relational reasoning within non- Western or non-English-speaking populations is constrained"
"It is constrained both by the exclusion of other relational reasoning forms (e.g., antithetical reasoning) and by demands on verbal and socio-cultural knowledge that may not be accessible to those populations"
"The Present Study Given these research gaps, further investigations into young children’s relational reasoning in non-western countries are warranted to expand current understanding"
"Thus, the present study was undertaken to build on Zhao et al"
"For one, we set out to administer the TORRjr to a sample of Korean children in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10; a population that has not been previously tested"
Our goals were to explore the changes in relational reasoning overall and by form for this age range
"Further, the grade levels included in this study extend beyond those for which the TORRjr was initially devised, allowing us to test the upper limits of the TORRjr"
The speciﬁc research questions guiding this investigation and the hypothesis were as follows: 1
"What do ﬁndings for Korean students in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 reveal about the psychometric properties and factor structure of the TORRjr"
"Based on the performance of the TORR (Dumas et al., 2014; Dumas and Alexander, 2018) and the recent study of the TORRjr with Chinese students (Zhao et al., 2020), we hypothesized that data from the TORRjr would be found to be psychometrically sound for students in grades 4 to 6"
"It remains unclear how the TORRjr will function for students in grades 8 and 10, given that these students are older than those for whom the TORRjr was originally developed"
"How do grade level and gender aﬀect students’ relational reasoning performance, as measured by the TORRjr"
We expected that grade level is a determinant of students’ relational reasoning performance
"In prior investigations involving populations of primary, elementary, and middle- school students and using various research methodologies and data sources, evidence emerged that certain forms of relational reasoning are earlier developing, speciﬁcally analogical and anomalous reasoning (Jablansky et al., 2016, 2019; Zhao et al., 2020)"
"In contrast to grade level, the gender eﬀects remain an open question with regard to the TORRjr"
"On the one hand, the TORR has been found to be invariant with regard to age, gender, and ethnicity for college-age students (Dumas and Alexander, 2018)"
"(2020) found a diﬀerence in TORRjr performance, with girls scoring higher than boys at grade 7"
"Thus, the ﬁndings from the current investigation may serve Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 630609"
"fpsyg-12-630609 March 2, 2021 Time: 12:20 # 4 Chae and Alexander Changes in Relational Reasoning to corroborate or disconﬁrm the gender eﬀect reported by Zhao et al"
To what extent is TORRjr a psychometrically appropriate measure of relational reasoning for older students (grades 8–10) compared to younger students (grades 4–6)
"With the inclusion of students from grades 8 and 10 in the current investigation, there was the opportunity to determine whether the TORRjr, which was originally developed for students in grades 3 to 7, would result in scores that were still reliable for these older students"
"Without data from prior studies upon which to rely, however, we cannot forward a prediction on the suitability of the TORRjr, especially for students in grade 8 who are at the cusp of the recommended grade range"
"What trends can be discerned in the overall TORRjr performance of the students in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10, and do these trends vary for the four individual scales"
A diﬀerent path of the developmental trajectory was expected varying forms of TORRjr
"The previous studies using the same measure (Zhao et al., 2020), the examination of adolescents’ relational reasoning utterances (Jablansky et al., 2016), or investigation using brain imaging techniques (e.g., Dumontheil et al., 2010) have commonly shown that reasoning performances show steep development by approximate age of 15 and later leveled oﬀ"
"However, studies incorporating all four forms of relational reasoning (e.g., Jablansky et al., 2016, 2019; Zhao et al., 2020) indicated early development of analogical and anomalous reasoning compared to that of antinomous and antithetical reasoning"
"MATERIALS AND METHODS The Educational Context All the students who participated in this study were from elementary, middle, and high schools in South Korea"
"Formal education in South Korea is referred to as the “6-3-3 schooling system, ” signifying 6 years of elementary school, 3 years of middle school, and 3 years of high school, with mandatory education beginning at age 7"
"When students enter middle school in seventh grade, they are approximately 13 years of age"
"In addition, the school year in South Korea begins in March, meaning that the participants from this study are older than United States students at the same grade level"
The elementary schools and middle schools in South Korea follow the principle of equalized allocation
"That means that there is heterogeneity concerning academic ability in elementary and middle-school classrooms (Korean Educational Development Institute, 2018)"
"In contrast, there are four types of high schools in South Korea that diﬀer in their educational aims: public high schools, special-purpose high schools, self-governing high schools, and specialized high schools (i.e., “Meister” schools)"
"The public high schools are academically heterogeneous, as are the elementary and middle schools"
"The educational purpose regards to cultivate the qualities of the democratic citizen who pioneer the career and to communicate with the world based on the achievement of middle school education (Korean Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, 2015)"
"Special-purpose, self-governing, and Meisterhigh schools target students with special needs, such as gifted students or students who want to go to prestigious colleges and provide vocational training (Korean Educational Development Institute, 2018)"
"Participants The participants in this study were 749 fourth ( Mage= 10), sixth ( Mage= 12), eighth ( Mage= 14), and tenth graders (Mage= 16) attending three schools (one school per school level) in Gangwon-do Province, South Korea"
"The area students were located in was a medium-sized city, mostly consisting of middle- class families"
"According to school records, all the participants were typical adolescents from the middle-class families"
All the students attending the schools on the day of data collection were involved in the data collection
The gender distribution and ages of participants by grade level are presented in Table 1 
Students in these grades were of particular interest to this study because this age range would aﬀord a more comprehensive view of relational reasoning development
"All participants, whether elementary, middle, or secondary students, pursued the public academic curriculum provided by the South Korean central government"
"All students who participated were included in the analysis, with the exception of ﬁve students who failed to respond to eight or more consecutive items on the TORRjr"
"Measure As discussed, the measure used to examine the changes in relational reasoning in this study was the TORRjr (Alexander and The Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory, 2019)"
"While the original measure was developed in English, it has subsequently been translated into Hebrew, Arabic, and Chinese"
"Following a procedure used in prior studies, the English version was ﬁrst translated into Korean by the ﬁrst author and then back-translated by an English language professor experienced in translation but blind to the purpose of the study"
"The back-translated version was then compared to the original wording of the TORRjr, and discrepancies between the two versions were corrected"
"The Korean version of the TORRjr was presented in booklet form, preceded by a demographics sheet requesting students’ date of birth, gender, and grade level"
This delivery format was deemed acceptable since no statistical diﬀerences have been found for paper vs
"The four scales were presented in a ﬁxed order (i.e., analogy, antinomy, antinomy, and antithesis), and each scale began with two sample items"
"No order eﬀects were reported in previous studies based on random-ordered versions (Dumas and Alexander, 2016; Zhao et al., 2020)"
"These sample items, which were not scored, were included to help students understand the directions and to reorient them as they moved to diﬀerent scales"
"For the analogy scale, for example ( Figure 1A ), students were directed to ﬁnd the shape from the six options that completed the pattern shown"
"The second scale, antinomy, asked the students to identify the shape that did not ﬁt the pattern ( Figure 1B )"

"Finally, for the antithesis scale (Figure 1D ), students were told to select the option that was the opposite of the process shown in the given problem"
Procedure The TORRjr was administered to students in their classrooms under the supervision of their classroom teacher
The students were told that they had all the time they required to complete the test
"However, all the students ﬁnished the test within a span of40–45 min"
"Before the test, students’ and their parents’ written consent forms were collected"
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Descriptive Statistics Table 2 shows the average relational reasoning scores as a function of grade level and gender
The average of the composite relational reasoning scores is indicative of an asymptotic developmental trend that transcends the age groups

"Further, except for grade 10, the students performed best on the analogy scale followed by antinomy, anomaly, and antithesis, respectively"
"While the tenth graders also performed best on analogies followed by antinomy, their antithetical reasoning was better than their anomalous reasoning"
The data distribution was normal for grade 4 but was found to be non-normal for higher grade levels
"Speciﬁcally, data skewness ranged from −1.74 to 0.15, depending on the grade and the form of relational reasoning, with the kurtosis ranging from −0.82 to 3.9 (see Table 3 )"
The skewness and kurtosis were non-signiﬁcant for grade 4 but became more serious toward higher grade levels
"McDonald’s omega for the internal reliability was 0.85 for grades 4–8, but dropped to 0.87 when all grade levels were included (grades 4–10)"
"Next, we checked item diﬃculties for each grade level (Table 4 )"
"Item diﬃculty in this study was the percentage of correct responses for each item, indicating the overall suitability of that item for the designated grades"
"Item diﬃculties between 0.20 and 0.80 are generally considered within an acceptable range (Kehoe, 1995)"
"In this study, the item diﬃculties for the total sample (grades 4 to 10) ranged from 0.36 to 0.92"
"Those rangesat the speciﬁc grade levels were as follows: 0.31 to 0.89, grade 4; 0.38 to 0.93, grade 6; 0.37 to 0.95, grade 8; and 0.37 to 0.93, grade 10"
"However, it should be noted that only one item (Analogy #4) was found to be very easy for respondents in grades 6 and 10 (i.e.,>0.90)"
This item is exclusively proper for the youngest student groups due to its extreme easiness for upper-grade levels
"However, other items seem to be within an acceptable range of easiness for the participants at most grade levels"
"No items in anomaly, antithesis, and antinomy were indicated as being extremely easy to students at every grade"
"These item diﬃculties indicated that the TORRjr was a little easier for this sample of South Korean children than had been reported for the norming sample of Chinese children in grades 3 to 7 (Zhao et al., 2020)"
"The analogy scale, followed by the anomaly scale, appeared to be the easiest for students at every grade level"
"Research Question 1: Factor Structure of the TORRjr To address psychometric properties and factor structure of the TORRjr in Korean students in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10, we tested the dimensionality of the data using latent factor analysis to determine the appropriate model ﬁt TABLE 3 | Skewness (S) and Kurtosis (K) by relational reasoning (RR) form and grade level"

We tested three models that had been indicated by prior investigation ( Figure 2 )
"The ﬁrst was a one-factor model, and the second was a four-factor correlated model"
"In the one-factor model, relational reasoning was assumed to load onto each item"
"In the four-factor model, relational reasoning was theorized to consist of four separate, but related, latent constructs corresponding to each of the four scales"
"The third was a higher-order model found to ﬁt TORRjr data best in the norming study carried out with Chinese children (Zhao et al., 2020)"
The higher-order model is presumed to consist of one overarching factor of relational reasoning that is not represented by but signiﬁcantly linked to the four factors representing eachof the scales
These four scales are comprised of the eight items loading onto each scale
The proposed three models were tested using conﬁrmatory factor analysis techniques with model-data ﬁt indices
The conﬁrmatory factor analysis showed that the one-factor model did not ﬁt the data well
"However, the four-factor model and the higher-order model were ﬁt for the data in this investigation ( Table 5 )"
"Speciﬁcally, the four-factor model and higher-order model produced the smallest values for Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (0.031), highest values for Comparative Fit Index (CFI; 0.933, 0.932) and Tucker-Lewis Index (0.927, 0.926)"
"This trend was consistent for data with grades 4 and 6 and the models appeared to marginally ﬁt data well according to rules of thumb (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003)"
"Data with grades 8 and 10 also favored the four-factor model and higher-order model, but did not reach the goodness of ﬁt standards"
"As a result, we concluded that the higher-order factor model was the best ﬁt for the TORRjr data for these Korean students due to the ﬁtness indices and the previous theoretical conﬁgurations ( Figure 2C )"
"In addition, the higher-order model was more parsimonious ( df= 460) than the competing four factor model ( df= 458)"
"This outcome parallels with ﬁndings from the calibration study (Zhao et al., 2020)"
"Figure 3 shows the coeﬃcients that were observed from the relational reasoning structure with the Korean samples in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10"
It was indicated that all 32 items loaded onto the appropriate scale of the TORRjr
"For example, the eight analogy items loaded onto the analogy scale, while the antinomy items loaded onto the antinomy scale"
"Further, the four forms signiﬁcantly loaded on the highest-order, relational reasoning factor"
"Research Question 2: Measurement Invariance Test The contribution of grade level and gender to students’ relational reasoning performance measured by the TORRjr was investigated by measurement invariance test ( Tables 6 ,7)"
"Speciﬁcally, using the measurement invariance function inR (Rosseel and Jorgensen, 2019), we tested four models that progressed from least to most constrained"
"In the least constrained model (conﬁgural invariance , Model 1), the paths for all psychometric components (i.e., factors loadings intercepts, and latent means) are presumed to vary by gender or by grade level"
"In contrast, for the most constrained model ( strict invariance , Model 4), it is presumed that all psychometric components would be the same regardless of gender or grade"
"For Model 2 ( metric invariance ), the factor loadings are assumed to be equivalent for the boys and girls and for fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth graders"
"In contrast, in Model 3 ( scalar invariance ), factor loadings and intercepts are expected to be similar for males and females and grade level"
"Gender Difference For the test of measurement invariance for gender, we ﬁrst eliminated data for 35 missing values on gender and then ran analyses for four models previously described"
"As the ﬁt statistics inTable 6 indicate, Model 3, representing scalar invariance , was the most statistically viable model"

"Speciﬁcally, as displayed in Table 7 , our chi-squared model-ﬁt indices already began to show signiﬁcant χ2changes from Model 1 (conﬁgural model ) tometric model (1χ2= 157.22, p<0.0001)"
"In other words, the metric model was signiﬁcantly worsened by adding more constraints to the conﬁgural model "
"Thus, although the higher-order factor structure functioned well for all grade levels, there were diﬀerences in the performance of the students in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 at the scale and item levels"
Such diﬀerences might be expected given the age ranges included in the study and in light of the pattern in relational reasoning development described previously
This outcome supports conducting separate standardizations of the TORRjr for the younger (grades 4 and 6) and older (grades 8 and 10) students
Research Question 3: Suitability of TORRjr for Grades 8 and 10 Whether the TORRjr is a psychometrically appropriate measure of relational reasoning for older students (grades 8–10) compared to younger students (grades 4–6) was tested above section in line with gender eﬀect using measurement invariance test
"Accordingly, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was evident between younger students’ and older students’ relational reasoning"
"Speciﬁcally, older students performed signiﬁcantly better at the TORRjr than younger students did"
"As we noticed in Figure 4 , the distribution of relational reasoning scores was close to normal in grades 4, 6, and 8"
"However, a ceiling eﬀect was apparent in the composite score of the TORRjr in grade 10 (see Figure 4 )"
"Given this trend, grade 8 seems to be the boundary for using the TORRjr"
"For grade 10, using the TORR seems preferable to using the TORRjr"
"Research Question 4: Trends by Grade Levels To explore the trends of overall TORRjr performance and the four individual scales in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10, we conducted an additional scale-level analysis using non-parametric median- based tests due to the non-normality of the data, as presented in Table 8 "
"Speciﬁcally, we ran the Kruskal–Wallis test to compare the four age groups and the Mann-Whitney Utest for post- hocanalysis"
"The use of a boxplot has been recommended to avoid missing important hidden information such as dispersion, the symmetry of data values, and outliers (Williamson et al., 1989)"
It should be noted that 5 non-responding students were excluded from the actual analysis because we assumed eight or more consecutive non-responses meant these failed to complete one entire scale on the TORRjr
The boxplot ( Figure 4 ) shows that the median scores increased to grade 8 and remained at a similar level from grades 8 to 10
The tenth graders’ scores were more negatively skewed than those of their younger counterparts
This suggests that the ceiling eﬀect is more likely to apply to these older students
"When scale-speciﬁc analyses were conducted, the data skewness was found to be more apparent for the more complex scales"
"For example, the medians of the analogy scale were 6 and 7 and those of the anomaly scale were 5 and 6 at grades 4 and 6"
The median of both the analogy and anomaly scales was 7 at grades 8 and 10
"In contrast, the diﬀerences between the grade levels were more considerable for the antinomy and antithesis scales"
"Speciﬁcally, the medians for the antinomy scale were 6, 6, 7, and 7 for the students at grades 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively, while the medians for antithesis scale were 4, 4, 6, and 7 for those same grades"
"In other words, the antithesis scale scores were lower at the lower age levels and increased up to grade 10, again suggesting a developmental trajectory"
"The non-normality of the data required the use of nonparametric tests that rely on the median (i.e., Kruskal– Wallis test) rather than the mean"
"This analysis revealed signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in the median scores of all the four forms of relational reasoning: analogy ( χ2= 47.604, df= 3, p<0.001), anomaly ( χ2= 43.597, df= 3, p<0.001), antinomy (χ2= 31.414, df= 3, p<0.001), antithesis ( χ2= 63.080, df= 3, p<0.001), and composite ( χ2= 74.022, df= 3, p<0.001)"
"In other words, the diﬀerences across the age groups were most prominent for antithesis"
The Mann-Whitney Utest was conducted as a post-hoc test ( Table 8 )

new insights about the nature of relational reasoning and the viability of the TORRjr as a measure of this fundamental cognitive ability for a yet untested population
"However, before we summarize those discernments, there are certain limitations that we must acknowledge"
Limitations One major limitation of the current investigation concerns the representativeness of the student sample
"Speciﬁcally, the students who participated were recruited from schools in Gangwon-do, one of South Korea’s nine provinces"
"Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these 749 students’ performance is representative of students’ performance nationally"
"Moreover, this study included only the TORRjr and did not incorporate any additional cognitive or academic measures to serve as indicators of convergent, discriminant, or predictive validity"
It will be essential to design subsequent studies that allow for more comprehensive validation of the TORRjr with a nationally representative sample of students in grades 3 to 7 – the range of the grade levels for which the TORRjr was initially designedand at which the test seemingly performs optimally for normally developing students
"Key Findings Despite the aforementioned limitations, important insights into children’s and young adolescents’ relational reasoning were garnered from this investigation"
"Psychometric Properties First and foremost, the present study demonstrated the viability of the TORRjr as a measure of relational reasoning for South Korean students, particularly those in grades 4 and 6"
"Even though the data for the students in grades 8 and 10 were acceptable at the item and factor levels, the distribution of data for these upper grades was non-normal with high skewness and kurtosis"
"This suggests that these older students might be better served by the TORR, which was developed expressly for adolescents and adults"
"Across all four grades, the item diﬃculties were determined to be within the acceptable range"
"However, certain items seem somewhat easier for the students in this study than in the prior Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 630609"
"fpsyg-12-630609 March 2, 2021 Time: 12:20 # 12 Chae and Alexander Changes in Relational Reasoning research with Chinese children in grades 3–7 (Zhao et al., 2020)"
"Further, the higher-order factor structure held for performance at both the lower grade levels and the upper-grade levels in both the current and prior investigations"
"Also, the higher-order factor model that emerged in this investigation as the best ﬁt of the data mirrored the model found previously for the TORRjr (Zhao et al., 2020) as well as for the TORR (Dumas and Alexander, 2016)"
"With regard to measurement invariance, the current study revealed grade level is a source of measurement variance but gender is not"
The variance due to grade level seems to partially related to the participants’ developmental patterns as we discuss later in this section
"In other words, the participants might tend to be measured diﬀerently by their grade levels because they were developed the way their age group was supposed to be developed"
"In contrast, the measurement invariance seems little to do with their gender"
"This invariance by gender opens up more discussions due to its inconsistency with previous investigation (Zhao et al., 2020) although the measurement invariance captured in this study is more promising for the use of TORRjr in the ﬁeld"
"Only according to the current study result, we can conclude TORRjr is a fair measure for relational reasoning in any gender"
"Developmental Trajectories Once the viability of the TORRjr was established for the current sample, a primary purpose of this study was to explore the developmental path of relational reasoning ability from students in grades 4 to 10"
We wanted to explore the trajectory based on the overall performance on the TORRjr and performance on the individual scales
"As noted in the theoretical framing, the developmental path for relational reasoning ability portrayed in the literature is unresolved"
"Some scholars have documented a decline in relational reasoning ability during adolescence (Carey et al., 1980; Diamond et al., 1983; Dumontheil et al., 2010), whereas others contend that the developmental path varies for the diﬀerent forms of reasoning considered (Jablansky et al., 2016, 2019; Zhao et al., 2020)"
"In this study, the developmental path for the TORRjr total score across grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 followed an asymptotic course, with a level oﬀ witnessed from grades 8 to 10"
"Such a ﬁnding seems to give credence to studies that reported a decline in relational reasoning ability during adolescence (Dumontheil et al., 2010)"
"However, the developmental trajectory followed a diﬀerent path when the lower grades (fourth and sixth) and upper grades (eighth and tenth) were tracked separately and when scale scores rather than a total score were the focus of analysis"
"When those changes were made, what emerged was a gradual and signiﬁcant improvement from grades 4 to 6 and from 6 to 8"
"Moreover, the leveling oﬀ we observed between grades 8 and 10 seemed primarily attributable to the ceiling eﬀect for the TORRjr within the older participants, rather than a decline in relational reasoning ability per se "
Even more enlightening were the shifts that occurred in the TORRjr scales over time
"In this study, as with others investigating the four forms of relational reasoning (Jablansky et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020), the analogy scale was the easiest for students at every grade level, followed by the antinomy scale.This is particularly important because the studies of relational reasoning that argue for a decline of this foundational ability in adolescence have only tested analogical reasoning"
The picture is far more complicated when antinomous and antithetical reasoning are added to the mix
"Speciﬁcally, while younger students in this study rely more on analogical and antinomous reasoning, as in prior investigations (Jablansky et al., 2016, 2019; Zhao et al., 2020), older students manifest increasing reliance on antinomous and antithetical reasoning"
"Thus, there is the continued development of relational reasoning ability as measured by the TORRjr, even among older students, but evidenced more by certain forms of reasoning"
Why do antinomous and antithetical reasoning follow a somewhat diﬀerent developmental path than analogical and anomalous reasoning
"For one, these forms of relational reasoning appear to be less familiar and more cognitively demanding"
"As seen in the sample problems in Figures 1C,D , solution of these items entail multiple steps to solve the problems"
"Speciﬁcally, with the antinomous scale, respondents must determine what attributes deﬁne the given problem set"
Then they must test the various options presented to ascertain which of the options have no elements in common with the given problem set
"Similarly, respondents to the antithesis items must ﬁrst grasp the conversion process depicted in the given problem and then reverse that process to ﬁnd the correct option"
"Overall, the performance of the four scales by younger and older students in this study suggests that relational reasoning ability continues to develop into adolescence"
"Yet, some of the various reasoning forms have an earlier onset than others"
"Therefore, the continued reliance solely on analogical reasoning as a relational reasoning marker eﬀectively masks signiﬁcant developmental patterns in this foundational cognitive ability"
"Future Directions While the current study unearthed several signiﬁcant ﬁndings about relational reasoning and its development for South Korean elementary and middle-school students, there is unquestionably more work to be done"
We identiﬁed several future studies that represent critical next steps in this research venue within the summary of key ﬁndings from this investigation
"Those future studies include the standardization of the TORRjr using a representative national sample of South Korean students in grades 3 to 7 and incorporating cognitive and academic measures that permit the assessment of the TORRjr’s convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity"
"Additionally, it would be worth considering the eﬀects of relational reasoning on the academic performance and development of speciﬁc atypical populations among the student population"
"For instance, it would be invaluable to understand the role that relational reasoning plays in the learning of various “identiﬁed” populations such as students with learning disabilities or those dealing with subject-speciﬁc problems in reading or mathematics"
"Within South Korean schools, there are also students who are signiﬁcantly older than their grade-level peers, due to events that disrupted or inhibited their formal Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 630609"
