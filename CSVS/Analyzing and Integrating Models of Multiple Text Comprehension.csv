Analyzing and Integrating Models of Multiple Text Comprehension Alexandra List1and Patricia A
"Alexander2 1Department of Educational Psychology, Ball State University 2Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methods, University of Maryland, College Park We introduce a special issue featuring four theoretical models of multiple text comprehension"
We present a central framework for conceptualizing the four models in thisspecial issue
"Speciﬁcally, we chart the models according to how they consider learner, texts, task, and context factors in explaining multiple text comprehension"
"In addition, the models are contrasted along three dimensions capturing different orientations toward multiple textcomprehension"
"Models in the special issue are described as more behaviorally or cognitively focused, as conceptualizing multiple text comprehension as an internally driven or an externally triggered process, and as directly responsive to or indirectly inﬂuenced bytask"
The importance and relevance of this special issue for research on multiple textcomprehension are discussed
"Multiple text comprehension (MTC) refers to the processes and behaviors whereby students make sense of complextopics or issues based on information presented not within asingle source but rather across multiple texts (Rouet, 2006;Wineburg, 1991)"
"The last 25 years have seen an explosion of research on MTC, corresponding to the advent and popu- larization of the World Wide Web and its increased integra-tion into the K-12 classroom and beyond (Alexander &DRLRL, 2012; Coiro, 2003; Leu et al., 2007)"
"This is evi-denced in both the prevalence of academic publicationsexplicitly referencing individuals’ use of multiple texts (Figure 1) and the increased discussion in published worksof terms like digital literacy andInternet literacy , to which MTC is integral (Figure 2)"
"Recognizing this trend, international scholars invested in the study of MTC and in the articulation of explanatorymodels of such comprehension were participants in a sym-posium at the American Education Research Association in2015"
"First,in recognition of the burgeoning research on multiple textuse, participants articulated what has been empirically established about the process of deriving and integratingmeaning across multiple documents (Bra /C14ten, 2008; Goldman & Scardamalia, 2013; Wiley & Voss, 1999;Wineburg, 1991)"
"Second, presenters thoughtfully consid-ered the particular challenges posed by multiple-text proc-essing, especially given the quantity and disparate characteristics of digital materials frequently involved in multiple text use (Rouet, 2006; Rouet & Britt, 2012)"
"Third,participants not only introduced their own respective mod-els of MTC but also examined the empirical, instructional,and intervention-related implications of their work"
"In developing this special issue, we wanted to build on the success of that symposium and expand on its worth-while goals"
"At the same time, this special issue is unique as it represents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst compilation of theoretical models of multiple text processing"
"Indeed, thefour models included herein are all explicitly connected towell-established models in this ﬁeld (i.e., documents model of multiple texts: Britt, Perfetti, Sandak, & Rouet, 1999; MD-TRACE: Rouet, 2006) while representing more con-temporary approaches to understanding the processes andconstructs underlying MTC"
"It was our expectation that offering the educational research community this compilation would both promotediscussion of these varied models and instigate efforts toidentify common ground among them, as well as to recognizeeach model’s unique contributions"
"Accordingly, within thisoverview, we begin by deﬁning MTC and then address twoquestions about the theoretical models included herein"

"Speciﬁcally, for all four models included, we brieﬂy describe how these models are similar and how they can be differenti- ated in their portrayal of MTC"
"That is to say, we asked the questions, What do these models have in common"
"We believe that the juxta-position of these models, along with this brief comparisonand contrast, will serve to identify future directions for inves-tigation and intervention, charting a course for the evolutionof this rapidly developing ﬁeld"
"To this end, this special issueconcludes with commentaries by two leading scholars in the ﬁeld of multiple text comprehension, Str ømsøand Stadtler"
These scholars both expand on the relations among the mod-els introduced in this special issue and discuss their strengthsand limitations
"Moreover, they connect these models toexisting theories of multiple text comprehension (Str ømsø, 2017/this issue) and consider their implications for instruc-tion and intervention (Stadtler, 2017/this issue)"
"The topic of this special issue, MTC, represents a critical area of examination"
"MTC encompasses a host of skills andstrategies invoked when students attempt to make sense ofa topic or issue based on information presented, not within a single source but rather across multiple sources of infor-mation (Rouet, 2006; Wineburg, 1991)"
"The skills neces-sary for MTC are diverse and interconnected, and theyinclude identifying, selecting, processing, comprehending,corroborating, evaluating, and integrating informationacross multiple documents (Rouet & Britt, 2012; Walraven,Brand-Gruwel, & Boshuizen, 2008)"
"Great interest in multiple text comprehension has devel- oped over the last 25 years, as the Internet has exponentiallyincreased the volume of information sources to which stu-dents have easy and instantaneous access (Alexander &DRLRL, 2012; Coiro, 2003; Leu et al., 2007)"
"At the sametime, today’s students have increasingly been called upon tounderstand and form opinions about complex topics like cli-mate change, Internet censorship, and pharmaceutical safety (Bra /C14ten, Str ømsø,&S al mer /C19on, 2011; Kiili, 2013; Stadtler, Scharrer, Brummernhenrich, & Bromme, 2013)"
"Problemssuch as these are complex in part because a single informa-tion source is typically insufﬁcient for critical understanding.Rather, students have to draw on multiple, varied sources ofinformation to conceptualize these issues (Britt, Rouet, &Braasch, 2013; Rouet, 2006)"
"In recognition of this 21st-cen-tury reality, the skills necessary for MTC have been deemed not only academically valuable but also fundamental prereq- uisites for democratic and economic citizenship in today’sknowledge-based societies (Ananiadou & Claro, 2009;Goldman & Scardamalia, 2013; Jenkins, Purushotma,Weigel, Clinton, & Robinson, 2009)"
"Yet, MTC has been found to be a distinctly difﬁcult activity for students, requiring them to contend with alarger volume of information than when processing single texts and to engage in qualitatively different cognitive undertakings when multiple texts are involved (Britt &Aglinskas, 2002; Wiley et al., 2009)"
"Speciﬁcally, learnershave been found to experience a host of processing chal-lenges associated with MTC"
"These include difﬁcultieswith effectively navigating among a multitude of informa-tion sources (Amadieu, Tricot, & Marin /C19e, 2010), FIGURE 1 Number of Google Scholar citations referencing “multiple texts,” by year"

"monitoring the comprehension of information and building elaborative connections across texts (Stadtler & Bromme,2007, 2008; Wiley & Voss, 1999; Wolfe & Goldman,2005), and evaluating varied documents that reﬂect differ-ing levels of trustworthiness and expertise (Bra /C14ten, Strømsø, & Britt, 2009; Kammerer & Gerjets, 2012; List, Alexander, & Stephens, 2016)"
Theories of MTC have emerged to explain the nature of the challenges of this undertaking
"Overall, the featured modelscan be conceptualized as explaining the challenges studentsface when processing conﬂicting information (Braasch &Bra /C14ten, 2017/this issue) or information that counters their existing beliefs (Richter & Maier, 2017/this issue)"
"Themodels also consider the inﬂuence of the speciﬁc task (List& Alexander, 2017/this issue) or particular context (Rouet, Britt, & Durik, 2017/this issue) on students’ actions"
"In this introduction, these models are conceptualized in terms oftheir commonalities and distinctions to better understandwhat is known about MTC and what still needs furtherelaboration"
"In selecting the theoretical models of MTC to incorporate into this special issue, we sought models that not only mani-fest some common ground but also afforded unique per-spectives on the comprehension and integration of multiple documents"
"To better illustrate these commonalities and distinctions, we present a framework for conceptualizingthe models included in this special issue"
"As shown inFigure 3, all the featured models are united in their explicitor implicit conception of MTC as an interaction between alearner , deﬁned by a host of individual difference factors, and a set of texts, related to one another in a myriad of ways, driven by a task, and occurring within a broader context "
The four models featured in this special issue provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the interrelationsamong MTC components
"First, Richter and Maier (2017/this issue) examine the role of individual difference factors, speciﬁcally prior knowledge and beliefs, in students’ proc- essing of multiple texts that agree or disagree with their ini-tial positions"
"As such, in their two-step veriﬁcation model,Richter and Maier most directly conceptualize the interrela-tions among the two innermost circles depicted in Figure 3.Next, in their discrepancy-induced source comprehension(DIS-C) model, Braasch and Bra /C14ten (2017/this issue) explain how the introduction of conﬂict across texts inﬂu- ences students’ attendance to source information (e.g., the author) and multiple text integration, relative to the presen-tation of consistent information"
"In this way, the DIS-Cmodel provides a theoretical foundation for understandingthe role of the cross-textual relations in MTC, representedin Figure 3 by the bidirectional arrows in the texts circle"
"Inthe cognitive affective engagement model (CAEM), Listand Alexander (2017/this issue) consider how learner char- acteristics and students’ interests and attitudes toward task and topic affect multiple text use"
"As reﬂected in Figure 3,the CAEM models the interrelations among task, texts, andlearner features of MTC"
"(2017/thisissue) introduce the RESOLV model, conceptualizing therole of contextual factors in shaping learners’ perceptionsof task and texts"
"Signiﬁed by the outermost circle in Fig-ure 3, the RESOLV model articulates how students’ repre- sentations of context impact all subsequent interactions with multiple texts"
Figure 3 can be used to map the models included in this special issue and to identify the components of MTC thateach of these models seeks to chieﬂy explain or has yet toexplicitly consider
"Beyond this common framework, how-ever, two additional assumptions underlying these modelsmust be acknowledged"
"First, all four of the models included in this special issue consider MTC to result from the enact- ment and coordination of varied skills and strategies, includ-ing goal setting and relevance determinations (Rouet et al.,2017/this issue), sourcing (Braach & Bra /C14ten, 2017/this issue), source evaluation (List & Alexander, 2017/this issue),and information veriﬁcation (Richter & Maier, 2017/thisissue)"
"Notably, across models, the skills emphasized arethose associated with evaluating sources and the information within them (List & Alexander, 2017/this issue; Richter & Maier, 2017/this issue) and those used to reduce the volumeof information inherent in any MTC situation to essentialcomponents (Braasch & Bra /C14ten, 2017/this issue; Rouet et al., 2017/this issue)"
"Second, given the constructs explored inthese models, all four theoretical approaches point to anymultiple text situation as being idiosyncratic, uniquely FIGURE 3 Interrelations among factors impacting learners’ interactions with multiple texts"
Note.$represents the interrelations among texts in a multiple text context.INTEGRATING MODELS OF MTC 145
"As such, these models push us to consider further whichaspects of MTC may be common across learners encounter-ing multiple texts and which may be unique to individualstudents completing particular tasks"
"Beyond the aforementioned commonalities, the four models populating this special issue can be distinguished from oneanother along a number of dimensions (see Figure 4)"
"Forone, these models differ in the extent to which they empha-size cognitive or behavioral aspects of MTC"
"For instance, although the documents model of mul-tiple texts (Britt et al., 1999) focuses on students’ cognitiverepresentations of the interrelations among texts, theMD-TRACE tends toward conceptualizing multiple textuse as a series of ﬁve, iteratively executed steps includingsearching for information and generating a written response(Britt & Rouet, 2012; Rouet, 2006)"
Such a distinction likewise holds when applied to the models included in this special issue
"For instance, Richterand Maier (2017/this issue) conceptualize the processwhereby students reconcile conﬂicting personal beliefswith information in text as cognitively based, or as reﬂect-ing learners’ engagement in a process of two-step veriﬁca-tion"
"In contrast, Braasch and Bra /C14ten (2017/this issue) adopt a more behavioral approach"
"Speciﬁcally, in the DIS-C model, they argue that the identiﬁcation of conﬂict across texts results in students’ greater attendance to and recall ofsource information"
"Second, these four models may be contrasted according to whether they specify the processes of multiple text com-prehension as predominantly driven by external (i.e., envi-ronmental) or internal (i.e., learner) factors"
"For instance,Braasch and Bra /C14ten (2017/this issue) suggest that factors external to the learner, speciﬁcally the presence of conﬂict in text, serve as the initiators of evaluative text processingand students’ attendance to source information, such as the author"
"(2017/this issue) adopt a more moder-ated stance, considering students’ representations of bothinternal and external contextual factors as driving MTC.Likewise, Richter and Maier (2017/this issue) considerlearners’ engagement in veriﬁcation to arise as a conse-quence of the interaction between learners’ existing knowl-edge or beliefs and information in text"
"Finally, List and Alexander (2017/this issue), at the other extreme of this continuum, suggest that individual difference factors, likelearners’ knowledge of source evaluation strategies andtheir motivations for task completion, drive multiple textprocessing"
A ﬁnal dimension distinguishing the models in this spe- cial issue deals with the way that each of these theoreticalapproaches conceptualizes the task driving MTC
"Speciﬁ- cally, these models differ according to whether they consider task to have a direct effect on processing or whether theyconsider an assigned task to be mediated through learners’perceptions and goals"
"At one end of the continuum, thetwo-step veriﬁcation model (Richter & Maier, 2017/thisissue) and the DIS-C (Braasch & Bra /C14ten, 2017/this issue) suggest that speciﬁc task assignments, such as those explic-itly directing students to attend to document information, result in the greater scrutiny of information sources"
"At the other end of the continuum, models by Rouet et al"
(2017/this issue) and List and Alexander (2017/this issue) focusspeciﬁcally on how learners subjectively conceptualize andrepresent the tasks they are assigned
"Looking across the distinctive features of each of these models, there emerges an outline of the characteristics of ametamodel of multiple text comprehension"
"Such a model would integrate both behavioral and cognitive aspects of MTC, represent the role of both internal (i.e., learner) andexternal (i.e., texts, task, context) factors impacting MTC,and explain how the tasks students are assigned andstudents’ conceptions of such assignments drive MTC"
"Indeveloping this special issue, it is our hope to move the ﬁeldtoward the development of such a metamodel"
"At the sametime, in featuring four distinctive approaches to MTC, we wanted to offer theoretical foundations for understanding the nuances and sensitivities of students’ interactions withmultiple texts"
"As MTC continues to increase in its curricu-lar and societal importance, theoretically representing itscomplexities represents an ambitious but necessaryendeavor, one undertaken by all of the authors in this spe-cial issue"
