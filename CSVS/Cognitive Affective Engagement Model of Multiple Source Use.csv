SENTENCES
"The MD-TRACE postulates that multiple text use unfolds through a series of ﬁve steps (Rouet & Britt, 2011).Speciﬁcally, once students are assigned a multiple text task,they develop a task model ; a cognitive representation of task demands that sets out goals for task completion (Step1)"
"In Step 2 of the MD-TRACE, students determine thatthey have an information need or decide that accessing mul- tiple texts is necessary to meet task demands"
"Step 3 involves students’ processing of multiple texts with three subprocesses speciﬁed: text selection, processing , and inte- gration "
"In Step 5, students make a determination regard-ing the extent to which their generated response comportswith task demands and with the task model developed inStep 1"
This determination results in students either re-cycling through previous steps in the MD-TRACE or deter- mining the task to be complete
"Complementing the MD-TRACE, the documents model framework explains how students integrate information thatis presented across multiple texts to form a uniﬁed under-standing of a particular topic or issue (Britt et al., 1999;Perfetti et al., 1999)"
"That is, the documents model articu-lates the comprehension processes involved in Step 3 of theMD-TRACE, text integration"
"Britt, Rouet, and Braasch (2013) suggested that in integrating multiple texts, students construct two cognitive models of the information pre-sented, the intertext model and the integrated mental model "
"The intertext model includes two types of connections:those between the information in a text and that text’s docu-ment information (i.e., metadata about author, publisher,source type) and those across texts using intertext predi- cates (e.g., agrees with, opposes, provides evidence for)"
The integrated mental model cognitively represents the common situation or issue described across multiple textsin a coherent and uniﬁed fashion
"In integrating multiple texts, then, students’ intertext and integrated mental models may be integrated to varyingextents"
"At one extreme, students may formulate a mush model , where information is integrated across texts but doc- ument information in the intertext model is ignored, leaving students unable to determine the relative trustworthiness of information, based on its sources of origin"
"At the otherextreme, an expert level, tag all model may be built"
"In the tag all model each piece of information is associated withits document of origin, based on the intertext model, and allinformation is considered in conceptualizing a common sit-uation described across texts, resulting in the constructionof a highly complex integrated mental model that, neverthe- less, may be too demanding for nonexperts to use"
"The opti- mal mental model for multiple text integration, consideredbest for good, novice comprehenders, has been termed thedocuments model (Britt et al., 1999)"
"Within the documentsmodel, only core events or key situational components are included in the integrated mental model"
These core eventsare associated with their sources of origin through theintertext model
"Linking the intertext and integrated mental models means that, in the documents model, focal discrep-ancies across texts are reconciled through the considerationof document information and as a result, key componentsof a situation, presented across multiple texts, areintegrated"
"The documents model outlines the cognitive processes involved in integrating multiple texts, just as the MD- TRACE identiﬁes the text use behaviors (e.g., text selection) involved"
"However, more needs to be understood regardingstudents’ reasons or motivations for constructing the intertextand integrated mental models in the ﬁrst place"
"Moreover,additional work is needed to explain how and why studentsengage in the cognitively demanding processes associatedwith developing a documents model or elect not to do so.The CAEM argues that both the consideration of document information in creating an intertext model and the integration of multiple texts in developing a documents model can beexplained, in part, by the level of students’ engagementwhen completing a multiple text task, as well as by learners’skills in carrying out these processes"
"WARM, MOTIVATED ENGAGEMENT Through more than a century of education and psychology research, interest, alongside other motivational factors, hasbeen strongly associated with text comprehension (e.g.,Alexander, Kulikowich, & Jetton, 1994; Dewey, 1913;Hidi, 2001)"
Individual inter- estrefers to students’ stable and sustained positive orienta- tion toward a topic or domain
"Applied to text engagement, this form of intrinsic interest has been termed topic interest (Schiefele, 2009)"
"Situational interest may be described as an externally triggered, temporary, state of arousal"
"Thisform of interest may be activated by elements in textincluding surprise, novelty, or personal relevance"
"Whentriggered, situational interest has been referred to as text- based interest (Hidi & Baird, 1986)"
"Both individual and situational interest have been found to effect learning from text (Hidi, 1990; Schiefele, 2001), reﬂected in a variety of text-based outcome measures,including text recall and retention, comprehension, andinferencing"
"Ainley, Hidi, and Berndorff (2002) proposedthat interest inﬂuenced performance as mediated bystudents’ affect (i.e., emotional self-ratings) and increasedpersistence (i.e., reading time) during task completion"
"Fur-ther, interest has been related to measures of text processing including deep-level versus surface-level strategy use (Scheifele, 1996, 2001), the integration of information intext with prior knowledge (Hidi, 1990; Kintsch, 1988;Schiefele & Krapp, 1996), and elaboration, allowing stu-dents to construct richer mental models of informationrelayed in text.COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL 183"
"Indeed, interest and other motivational factors have been found to exert an “independent and differentiated” effect ontext processing, relative to prior knowledge and other cog-nitive factors (Schieﬂe, 2009;p"
"In addition to inter-est, another learner characteristic, students’ attitudes , has been found to play both a motivational and cognitive rolein text processing"
"Attitudes have been deﬁned as students’general judgments or evaluations of a speciﬁc topic or issue (Petty & Brinol, 2010)"
A number of studies have examined the impact of atti- tudes on text processing and performance
"Generally, stu-dents holding strong attitudes about an issue have beenfound to process information in a way that supports themaintenance of these existing attitudes and a resistance toattitude change (Kardash & Scholes, 1996; Mason &Boscolo, 2004; Taber & Lodge, 2006)"
"In a classic study, Lord, Ross, and Lepper (1979) found that when students holding strong attitudes about a social issue (i.e., death pen-alty) were presented with both attitude-consistent and atti-tude-inconsistent texts, they processed those textsdifferently"
"Speciﬁcally, information and evidence consis-tent with students’ attitudes were processed at the surfacelevel, without further evaluation, whereas evidence contra-dictory to students’ views was scrutinized"
"Moreover, students have been found to rate attitude consistent information and arguments as moreconvincing, plausible , and quality , as compared to attitude inconsistent information (de Pereyra, Britt, Braasch, &Rouet, 2014; Lord et al., 1979; Munro & Ditto, 1997;Wolfe & Kurby, 2016; Wolfe, Kurby, & Taylor, 2011).Elsewhere, students have been found to simply ignore information deemed to be attitude inconsistent, while pref- erentially selecting and attending to attitude consistentinformation (Nickerson, 1998)"
"Students engaging in thiskind of information use have been described as evidencingaconformation bias or as engaging in case building or motivated text processing , with the goal of attitude mainte- nance or attitude defense (Taber & Lodge, 2006)"
"Although few models have emerged to comprehensively specify the mechanisms whereby attitudes may affect text processing, their role has been identiﬁed in students’ selec-tion of information sources (Brannon, Tagler, & Eagly,2007; van Strien, Brand-Gruwel, & Boshuizen, 2014),selective attention allocation during reading (Graf & Aday,2008; Maier & Richter, 2013; Wiley, 2005), and text evalu-ation (de Pereyra et al., 2014; Edwards & Smith, 1996;Lord et al., 1979; Taber & Lodge, 2006)"
The role of interest and attitudes has most commonly been explored in studies of single text processing
Limitedwork has considered the part these motivational factorsmay play in multiple text use
Yet there is reason to believethat these “warm” characteristics are quite important whenstudents engage with multiple texts
"Consistent with the lit-erature that has variably used the term engagement to referto students’ affective or emotional, cognitive, or behavioral involvement in learning (Connell, 1990; Corno & Mandi-nach, 1983; Greene & Miller, 1996; Guthrie et al., 1996;Ryan, 2000; Skinner & Belmont, 1993), engagement isused here as an umbrella term to describe learners’ affec-tive, cognitive, and behavioral involvement in multiple textuse"
"As an example, interest may serve as a much-neededresource for sustaining students’ attention during multiple text task completion and for supporting the expenditure of cognitive effort (Bra /C14ten & Str ømsø, 2006)"
"Likewise, atti- tudes may play a prominent role in determining the textsthat students elect to access and therefore process when pre-sented with the wealth of information inherent in multipletext use (Maier & Richter, 2014)"
"INTEGRATING COLD AND WARM PERSPECTIVES WITHIN MULTIPLE TEXT USE Strictly cognitive (i.e., cold) approaches to multiple text use have been limited in examining the affective and motiva-tional factors impacting text engagement, and work oninterest and attitudes (i.e., warm factors) has been appliedto multiple text processing only to a limited extent"
"Never-theless, cold andwarm perspectives on multiple text use have been cojoined to some degree"
"Interest, for one, has been modeled alongside cognitive factors in studies of multiple text use"
"Str ømsø,Br a /C14ten, and Britt (2010) found that interest and two cognitive factors(i.e., prior knowledge and memory for source information)positively predicted students’ performance on an intertextintegration task"
"Bra /C14ten, Anmarkrud, Brandomo, and Strømsø(2014) modeled the effects of situational and indi- vidual interest on multiple text comprehension, along with cognitive factors (i.e., prior knowledge, need for cognition,effort expended, and reported deep strategy use)"
"(2014) found that although individual interest affected situational interest, neither had a directeffect on multiple text comprehension"
"However, situationalinterest did have a strong effect on reported strategy use, andstrategy use, in turn, affected comprehension"
"Also, individ- ual interest had an effect on effort expended, which affected multiple text comprehension"
"(2014) suggested a distinct role for both cognitive and motivationalfactors in multiple text processing, more work is needed tomore precisely characterize these effects"
"For the most part, attitudes have been examined in con- junction with cognitive factors in studies of single text proc- essing"
"For instance, Kardash and Scholes (1996) found both attitudinal valence (i.e., strength) and students’ need for cog- nition to independently predict performance"
"Speciﬁcally,attitudinal strength was associ ated with students maintaining or arriving at an attitude-biased conclusion after text engage- ment"
"However, for students exhibiting a high need for cog-nition (i.e., those reporting a willingness to exert cognitive184 LIST AND ALEXANDER"
"effort to solve complex problems), attitudinal effects on text processing were mitigated ( Kardash & Scholes, 1996)"
"At the same time, students with a low need for cognition werestrongly guided by their attitude s, dismissing or ignoring atti- tude inconsistent information"
"These ﬁndings suggest a corre- spondence between moti vational and cogniti ve factors that is potentially reciprocal, whereby motivational factors serve tocompensate for limitations in students’ cognitive capacities to process texts and vice versa"
"Elsewhere, a compensatory and reciprocal relation between cognitive and affective fac-tors has been identiﬁed (e.g., Maier & Richter, 2014; Wiley,2005; Wolfe, Tanner, & Taylor, 2013)"
"The n, we introduce each of the four CAEM default stance proﬁles and discuss how these may be distinguished from one another"
"Third, we discuss how CAEM proﬁles may be expected to differwith regard to common multiple text use behaviors(e.g., text selection, evaluation) and performance out-comes (e.g., recall, integration)"
"After the CAEM isintroduced, we speciﬁcally delineate the scope of thismodel and discuss advantages of the CAEM relative toother models of multiple text use"
The article closes with a discussion of CAEM limitations and directions for future research
"COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL OF MULTIPLE SOURCE USE Like cognitivist models of multiple text use (Rouet, 2006; Rouet & Britt, 2011), the CAEM examines processing initi- ated by a task assigned to or self-developed by students"
"The term task is used, here, in its most general form, to encompass both the speciﬁc academic assignments that stu-dents may receive and students’ general desires to learnabout a particular topic or issue.Every task, assigned or self-developed, may be deﬁned by two factors: topic and expected cognitive product"
Atask’s topic refers to the subject areas or domains and sub- domains within which it is nested
A task’s cognitive prod- uctrefers to the information gains or learning outcome(s) that students expect to result from text access
"These mayinclude both general (e.g., knowing more, forming an argu-ment) and more speciﬁc (e.g., deﬁning a term, identifying an example) text use outcomes (List et al., 2016b)"
The way that cognitive products are deﬁned in the CAEMallows these to emerge in response to both externallyassigned tasks and to students’ personal interests or motiva-tions to learn about particular topics
"Once students deﬁne atask in terms of its topic and expected cognitive products,the task is further conceptualized in light of learners’ affec-tive and motivational inclinations (i.e., interest and atti- tudes), as well as their prior knowledge"
"This results in students adopting a default stance toward task completion, or a motivational and cognitive orientation toward the task.Students’ default stance informs text engagement andguides the multiple source use behaviors they manifest.This process is depicted in Figure 1"
"Two CAEM Dimensions According to the CAEM, students may adopt one of four default stance proﬁles when engaged in multiple text com-prehension"
These proﬁles are deﬁned by two dimensions:affective engagement andbehavioral dispositions toward text evaluation and information veriﬁcation
The affectiveengagement dimension of multiple text access reﬂects thedegree of students’ motivation for task completion
"Withinthe CAEM, this motivation is attributable primarily to students’ interest in and attitudes toward a particular topic or task but may also reﬂect other motivational constructs,like students’ efﬁcacy beliefs and task value"
The behav-ioral dispositions dimension captures the extent to whichstudents have mastered the skills necessary to evaluate FIGURE 1 Sequence of the cognitive affective engagement model of multiple source use.COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL 185
"Moreover, this dimension captures the extent towhich these skills are habituated or commonly engaged bylearners"
These two dimensions were identiﬁed by reviewing the literature on both multi ple source use and single text processing
"In considering this literature, our goal wasto locate those factors that seemed to make a difference in students’ multiple text processing and performance"
"The multiple text literature has identiﬁed a host ofexternal or task-related factors impacting processing(e.g., task type: Wiley & Voss, 1999; note taking:Kobayashi, 2009; modality of text presentation: Britt & Aglinskas, 2002)"
"At the same time, we were speciﬁ-cally interested in determining the student-level or indi-vidual difference factors that make a difference in multiple text processing"
"Consistent with this goal, Goldman, Braasch, Wiley, Graesser, and Brodowinska(2012) and Wiley et al.’s (2009) extreme cases analysisfound that differences in stu dents’ learning from a mul- tiple text task were primarily attributable to differencesin their source evaluation, such as their selection of reli-able sources of information over unreliable texts.Indeed, the importance of source evaluation for multiple text integration has been emphasized throughout much of the literature (Braasch,R ouet, Vibert, & Britt, 2012; Britt & Aglinskas, 2002; Stadtler & Bromme, 2014) andis reﬂected in the CAEM through the behavioral disposi-tions dimension"
The affective engagement dimension emerged from an examination of factors considered to be key to students’single text processing
"Models of single text comprehension have long focused on motivation, alongside cognitive fac- tors, as impacting reading (Kintsch, 1980; Wigﬁeld &Guthrie, 2000)"
"Indeed, motivation (i.e., interest) has beenfound to be associated with both behavioral (e.g., persis-tence) and cognitive (e.g., depth of text processing; Ainleyet al., 2002; Alexander et al., 1994; Fulmer & Frijters,2011; Schiefele, 1999) aspects of text processing"
"In theCAEM, learners’ motivation for task completion is cap- tured by the affective engagement dimension"
"Although motivational constructs have been conceptualized as multi-dimensional in nature, including affective, cognitive, andbehavioral components (Pintrich & De Groot, 1990), theterm affective engagement is used in the CAEM to speciﬁ- cally emphasize the affective or emotionally reactiveaspects of motivation"
"At the same time, the CAEM alsocaptures these other aspects of motivation, including goals and values, albeit to a less explicit extent"
"Default Stances According to the CAEM, students may assume one of four default stance proﬁles: (a) disengaged, (b) affectivelyengaged, (c) evaluative, or (d) critical analytic defaultstances"
These proﬁles reﬂect the degree of students’ affec- tive engagement with a particular task and topic andstudents’ habits with regard to source evaluation and infor-mation veriﬁcation
"The term default stance is used here to indicate a predisposition toward, generally,approaching multiple text tasks in a particular way (e.g.,evaluating source information), based on prior experience with such tasks"
"At the same time, we recognize that certain task factors (e.g., explicitly cuing evaluation) or topics(e.g., of high individual interest) may elicit the adoption ofcertain default stance proﬁles over others"
"As such, thedefault stance that students adopt toward a task and topicmay be considered to be the result of both individual andsituation-speciﬁc factors"
Adisengaged default stance is charac- terized by both the absence of affective engagement with the topic of the task and a lack of habituation toward sourceevaluation
"Students who are disengaged are unlikely toself-generate a task, as this may be associated with motiva-tion (e.g., topic interest)"
"Rather, they likely adopt a disen-gaged default stance toward an externally assigned task,seeking to minimally satisfy task demands while limitingeffort expenditure, or to default to task-satisﬁcing source use"
"Students adopting a disengaged default stance have else- where been described as engaging in information manage- ment, or the cognitively low-level, direct transference of information in texts to a task response, without furthermanipulation or evaluation (Alexander & the DisciplinedReading and Learning Research Laboratory, 2012)"
"Studiesexamining patterns in students’ navigation or text access have likewise identiﬁed a source use proﬁle consistent with a disengaged default stance, characterized by limited textaccess and low strategic engagement (e.g., limited textrevisits; Kiili, Laurinen, & Marttunen, 2008; Lawless,Mills, & Brown, 2002; List & Alexander, 2017; List et al.,2016a)"
Students experiencing a strong reaction toward a task may adopt an affectively engaged default stance toward multiple text use
The CAEM emphasizes students’ interest and attitudes as theindividual difference factors most likely to deﬁne thisdefault stance
"These are the focal motivational variablesexamined because students’ interest and attitudes havebeen conceptualized as having both cognitive and affectivecomponents and because these have been understood as resulting from a learner-content interaction (Alexander, 2003; Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Hidi, Renninger, & Krapp,2004; Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960; Wolfe et al., 2013)"
"Although students adopting an affectively engaged default stance may be motivated multiple source users,these students may also be limited in exhibiting the habits186 LIST AND ALEXANDER"
"Indeed, students adopting an affectively engaged default stance may be considered to engage in information accumulation (Bra/C14ten & Str ømsø, 2011), characterized by persistence in gathering as much information as possible toprolong engagement with texts and topic, but not by theidentiﬁcation of relationships across texts or the integrationand evaluation of information"
"In part, this absence ofhigher level processing may be the result of deﬁcits in theunderlying skills associated with multiple text integration; in part, extreme immersion in information accumulation may distract from higher level processing (Garner, Gilling-ham, & White, 1989; Harp & Mayer, 1998)"
"In describing the role of interest in single text process- ing, Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, and Goetz (1977) pro-posed the slot hypothesis "
"In this hypothesis, students’ interest is associated with the development of schema-based cognitive structures, such that when students read, interest-related information is slotted or added into these structures with ease, facilitating comprehension"
"Such slot-ting, although consistent with an information accumulationapproach to multiple text use, is not predicated on informa-tion evaluation or on deep-level comprehension"
"When stu-dents hold strong attitudes about a topic, they are likely to process attitude-consistent information at the surface level, without scrutiny, while ignoring or dismissing informationthat is attitude inconsistent (Lord et al., 1979; Maier &Richter, 2013; Nickerson, 1998; Wiley, 2005)"
"Students adopting an evaluative default stance may be principally characterized as havingwell-developed habits associ ated with diligent, evalua- tive source use"
"Students exhibiting this default stancem a yb ec ons ide re dt oro ut in ely engage in a variety of behaviors associated with so urce evaluation and infor- mation veriﬁcation (e.g., chec king information currency, verifying author credentials), as assessed by measuressuch as the Credibility Assessment Scale (Hargittai,Fullerton, Menchen-Tervino, & Thomas, 2010)"
"Of noteis that students adopting such an evaluative defaultstance would likely routinely engage in these behaviors, even absent particular task or topic interest"
"At the same time, students adopting this default stance may be some-what immature in their text evaluation"
"Think-aloud datahave shown that although they may readily apply heuris-tics to evaluating texts (e.g., books are trustworthy sour-ces; Brem, Russell, & Weems, 2001; List et al., 2016b),they may fail to engage in the more cognitivelydemanding and epistemically sophisticated processes necessary to resolve discrepancies across sources and integrate information (B arzilai & Zohar, 2012; Bra /C14ten, Britt, Str ømsø, & Rouet, 2011)"
The ﬁnal default stance identiﬁed includes students adopting a critical analytic approach to multiple source use
"This default stance is initiated when stu-dents have both well-formed habits associated with critical,evaluative source use and are engaged by the topic of a par- ticular task"
"When students are both affectively engaged and evaluative in their multiple text use, they may be engaged inknowledge building (Alexander & the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory, 2012), or the purposeful,elaborative, and reﬂective processing of information acrosstexts (Murphy, Rowe, Ramani, & Silverman, 2014).FIGURE 2 Default stance proﬁles identiﬁed in the cognitive affective engagement model of multiple source use.COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL 187"
"Elsewhere, small subsamples of students have been found to engage in the kinds of strategic and evaluative text use thatseems to be consistent with the adoption of this defaultstance (Goldman et al., 2012; Kiili et al., 2008; List et al.,2016a, 2016b; MacGregor, 1999; Wineburg, 1991)"
"An assumption of the CAEM is that the adoption of such a default stance may be considered the ideal and may resultin documents model construction, as speciﬁed by Britt et al"
"Nevertheless, resolving discrepancies and integrat- ing multiple texts constitutes an effortful and cognitivelydemanding process for the typical student (Braten &Strømsø, 2006; Britt et al., 1999; Rouet, 2006)"
"The CAEM suggests that for students to engage in this effortful process,they must have (a) the skills and habits to do so effectivelyand efﬁciently and, more important, (b) the motivation todo so"
"As laid out in the CAEM, moving beyond perfunc- tory or heuristic-based text evaluation, to evaluate sources in the service of multiple documents integration, requires aspeciﬁc motivational driver"
Distinguishing Default Stance Proﬁles It is important to distinguish students’ adoption of a critical analytic default stance from the other default stance proﬁlesthat students may assume
"This is best done through exam- ple, speciﬁcally by examining the role of attitudes, as a motivational factor, in students’ multiple text processing.As conceptualized in the CAEM, the motivations that drivestudents to engage in biased reasoning or case building, orto critically evaluate their own position on a target issue,are one and the same"
"The distinction among these is that,in one case, attitude-based motivation is coupled with dili-gent skills and habits with regard to source evaluation, lead- ing to the adoption of a critically analytic default stance, whereas in the other case it is not, resulting in only affec-tively engaged multiple source use"
"In the literature on attitude-based text processing, two patterns of ﬁndings have been identiﬁed"
"First, strong atti-tudes toward task topic have been found to result in selec-tive information processing (i.e., biased assimilation), suchthat attitude consistent information is easily assimilated into models of comprehension while attitude inconsistent information is ignored (e.g., Maier & Richter, 2013; Taber& Lodge, 2006; van Strien et al., 2014)"
"At the same time,in certain situations, such as when explicitly prompted todo so (Kardash & Scholes, 1996; Mair & Richter, 2013;McCrudden & Sparks, 2014), students have been found toovercome their tendencies toward attitude-driven reasoningand biased assimilation to evaluate information in a more objective and impartial manner (Kobayashi, 2014; Taber & Lodge, 2006)"
This seemingly contradictory set of ﬁndingsreﬂects distinctions in default stance proﬁles identiﬁed inthe CAEM
"When students are engaged in motivated rea-soning, or text processing with the goal of attitude mainte-nance, they may be said to have adopted an affectivelyengaged default stance toward multiple source use"
"These students are in information pursuit, without the correspon-dent critical evaluation of this information"
Attitude-basedaffective engagement with multiple texts may result eitherfrom students having attitudes so strong that their motiva-tion for attitude maintenance overrides other evaluativeconsiderations or from learners lacking the skills or disposi-tions necessary to critically evaluate information in texts
"In cases where learners with strong attitudes encounter multiple texts, they may adopt a critical analytic defaultstance toward text access"
"Such a stance is deﬁned by learn-ers being motivated, not simply by attitude maintenance butalso by a desire to establish the relative merits or veracity ofinformation encountered"
"Qualitative data from McCruddenand Sparks (2014) indicate that students’ adoption of a criti-cal analytic default stance, in association with strong atti- tudes about a topic, manifests in one of two ways"
"Learnersm a ye ng ag ei ne it her belief protection (i.e., scrutinizing con- ﬂicting information in the service of belief maintenance) orbelief reﬂection (i.e., attitude adjustment or revision in response to conﬂicting information)"
Both of these processesare supported by learners’ attitude-based motivations for textaccess and skills in source evaluation and information veriﬁ-cation
"At the same time, whether students elect to engage in belief reﬂection or belief protection is the result of the rela- tive strength of their attitudes vis- /C18a-vis their habituation to the critical evaluation of information, as well as other factors(e.g., epistemic beliefs) not speciﬁed in the CAEM"
Examining how interest drives multiple text use points to the distinction between affectively engaged and criticalanalytic processing
"Speciﬁcally, students demonstratinghigh interest in a topic may elect to engage in information accumulation (Bra /C14ten & Str ømsø, 2011)"
"However, addi- tional skills are necessary for learners to successfully syn-thesize and integrate this information to achieve cross-textual comprehension"
"When motivation for text access iscoupled with the skills needed to evaluate sources andinformation critically, learners successful adopt a criticalanalytic default stance"
A critical analytic default stance toward text access may further be distinguished from learners’ adoption of an eval- uative default stance
Both of these default stance proﬁlesare characterized by students having the skills and strate-gies necessary for source evaluation and multiple text inte-gration
"At the same time, evaluative students, althoughhabituated to source evaluation, may not have the speciﬁcmotivation in place to engage deeply with sources and con-tent"
"As a result, we may expect such students to approach multiple text comprehension in a perfunctory manner, fol- lowing certain routine rules of thumb, without fully consid-ering the speciﬁc evaluative demands posed by particulartask or texts (List et al., 2016b)"
"For example, evaluativestudents may use a document-type heuristic when judgingtext trustworthiness (e.g., trusting books; Brem et al., 2001;List et al., 2016b)"
"take the added steps of corroborating information across texts or considering additional document features in theirjudgments, like information currency"
"As an additional distinguisher, evaluative students would not be expected to judge texts in a contextuallynuanced way, as may be expected from critical analyticsource users, this being a marker of epistemic competenceor sophistication (Grossnickle Peterson, Alexander, & List, 2017)"
"An example of contextually nuanced source evalua- tion comes from a study asking undergraduate students tocomplete a multiple text task, featuring both print and digi-tal texts (List, Alexander, & Stephens, 2017)"
"Studentsadopting an evaluative default stance were found to be suc-cessful in distinguishing among more or less trustworthysources (e.g., newspapers vs"
"At the same time,these students were found to be overly rigid in their assess- ments, neglecting to consider that social media (e.g., Twit- ter), although generally regarded as less trustworthy, mightnevertheless prove informative when issues are unfoldingin real time"
Source Use Behaviors A default stance may be used not only to proﬁle students’ approaches to multiple text use but also to interpret behav-iors associated with text access
"Five text use behaviors may be expected to differ across default stance proﬁles: (a) time on texts, (b) text access, (c) text processing, (d) sourc-ing, and (e) cessation of text use"
"These behaviors wereidentiﬁed as key in earlier models of multiple text compre-hension (i.e., information problem solving using the Inter-net [IPS-I]: Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis, & Walraven, 2009;MD-TRACE: Rouet & Britt, 2011)"
"In addition, three out-comes of multiple text processing (i.e., text recall, multiple text integration, and changes within the individual) are examined here in association with students’ default stanceassumption"
"Among the most common behavioral indicators examined in the literature has been the totalamount of time students devote to text use, as well as the amount of time they spend on accessing particular texts (Duggan & Payne, 2011; Kintsch, Kozminsky, Streby,McKoon, & Keenan, 1975; Reader & Payne, 2007)"
"Timeon texts has been variably interpreted as indicative ofstudents’ effort expenditure (Bra /C14ten et al., 2014) or degree of engagement (Guthrie, Wigﬁeld, Metsala, & Cox, 1999).Considering CAEM established proﬁles offers insights intothe validity of such interpretations"
Students adopting an affectively engaged or critical ana- lytic default stance toward multiple text use may beexpected to devote the most time to text access
"For both ofthese proﬁles, students’ engagement or interest in the texttopic may be protracted"
"Indeed, the association betweeninterest and other affective factors and time devoted to textaccess has been documented in studies involving both sin- gle (e.g., Ainley et al., 2002) and multiple (Bra /C14ten et al., 2014) texts"
"Nevertheless, additional differences in the timespent on particular texts may emerge across the fourproﬁles"
"For example, students adopting a disengaged default stance may be expected to rapidly sequence through textslooking for “the answer” while not spending substantial amounts of time on any one text accessed"
"In contrast, stu- dents in the affectively engaged proﬁle may devote a uni-formly long time to reading all texts addressing a topic ofinterest"
"Those adopting an evaluative or critical analyticdefault stance may display more varied text-processingtimes, alternating between spending a long time readingreliable sources, providing credible information, andquickly scanning and moving on from texts they consider to be low in trustworthiness"
"Students adopting default stan- ces evidencing a habituation toward text evaluation may beconsidered to be better at discriminating between texts high and low in reliability (Braasch, Bra /C14ten, Str ømsø,& Anmarkrud, 2014; Goldman et al., 2012; Wiley et al.,2009), with such discrimination manifest as variations inaccess time across reliable and unreliable texts (Kammerer,Kalbfell, & Gerjets, 2016)"
"When presented with the opportunity to select from among a set of texts, students differing inassumed default stance may also differ in the number andquality of texts accessed and in their text navigation (i.e.,order of text access)"
"For students adopting a disengageddefault stance, source access likely unfolds in a sequentialmanner"
"Students looking to locate a speciﬁc answer acrosstexts likely access each available source in order until an acceptable response is identiﬁed (i.e., a satisﬁcing strategy ; Reader & Payne, 2007)"
"Consequently, students may poten-tially access quite a large number of texts in the service ofidentifying an explicitly stated task response"
"Reader andPayne (2007) further describe this satisﬁcing approach totext navigation as manifest in students cycling throughtexts, in order, until identifying one meeting their needsand as characteristic of the vast majority of navigation (more than 75% of students; Wilkinson, Reader, & Payne, 2012)"
"Students assuming an affectively engaged default stance likely access texts preferentially, in an order reﬂecting thestrength of the correspondence between their interest andthe text topic"
"Others have likewise identiﬁed an interest-driven source selection heuristic (Ainley et al., 2002; Sal-mer/C19on, Kintsch, & Ca ~nas, 2006)"
"When texts all address a topic of interest, students adopting this proﬁle may access more texts, as compared to the other proﬁles"
"Further, anevaluative default stance may correspond to studentsaccessing a limited number of texts but being selective andpurposeful in the texts they choose"
Students adhering tothis default stance proﬁle may access texts presentingCOGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL 189
"heuristic-based indicators of reliability, like data or cita- tions (e.g., journal articles; Brem et al., 2001) and may beexpected to access multiple texts to corroborate or verifyinformation"
"Nevertheless, the total number of texts theyaccess, overall, may be quite limited"
"Low in engagementor motivation for text access, students assuming an evalua-tive default stance may be expected to refrain from pro-tracted source use"
"Like students adopting an evaluative default stance, stu- dents falling into the critical analytic default stance proﬁlewould likely access texts evidencing high levels of trust-worthiness"
"But unlike their evaluative counterparts, thesestudents may also be likely to access a substantial numberof texts, reﬂecting engagement with the topic of the task.Although students adopting an evaluative default stancewould likely select texts highest in reliability, regardless of task, those approaching texts in a critical analytic fashion may adapt their evaluative standards to match task demandsand the cognitive products expected"
"Reader and Payne (2007) described a number of sophisticated navigation str ategies that students, belong- ing to the critical analytic—and to a lesser extent evalu-ative—proﬁles, may adopt in selecting quality sourcesfor task completion"
Among these is sampling or scan- ning through available sources quickly before selecting the best texts to draw on
"More simplistically, strategicnavigation, featuring behav iors like text revisits (i.e., repeated, nonsequential text access) to verify informa-tion, may also be indicative of the adoption of an evalu-ative, or more probably a criti cal analytic, default stance toward multiple text use (Goldman et al., 2012; List &Alexander, 2017; Salmer /C19on & Garc /C19ıa, 2011; Salmer /C19on et al., 2006; Wiley et al., 2009)"
"Looking across the four defa ult stance proﬁles, these may be distinguished by (a) the number of texts studentsaccess (e.g., affective engagement proﬁle), (b) the qualityof texts accessed (e.g., evaluative and critical analyticproﬁles), and (c) whether order of access is sequential(e.g., disengaged proﬁle) or more purposeful"
"Spe- ciﬁcally, they identiﬁed students as knowledge seekers,feature explorers, or apathe tic hypertext users"
"Although imperfect analogues, the di fferences among navigation proﬁles that Lawless et al"
"Spe ciﬁcally, both knowledge seeker and feature explorer proﬁles accessed materialssigniﬁcantly longer than did apathetic hypertext users"
"Further, although those int he knowledge seeker proﬁle, corresponding to a critical analytic default stance,accessed more quality hypertext links using more sophis- ticated navigation strategies, feature explorers accessedthe largest number of multimedia sources (e.g., pictures,videos), considered to be of high interest, as we wouldexpect for the affectively engaged.Text processing"
"Students’ multiple text processing has been differentiated as reﬂecting skimming (i.e., rapid, selective scanning) or reading (i.e., sustained, linear text processing; Foltz, 1996)"
"In turn, reading has been found toinclude both surface- and deep-level text processing (Beiz-huizen & Stoutjesdijk, 1999)"
"Surface-level processing islinear and serialistic , involving students reading through information, in the order in which it appears, and attending to details in text"
"Deep-level processing is more global or holistic and includes students drawing inferences and relat- ing aspects of text to one another to formulate conclusions(Beizhuizen & Stoutjesdijk, 1999; Pask, 1976; Salmer /C19on, Naumann, Garc /C19ıa, & Fajardo, 2017)"
"Although skimming, surface-level, and deep-level text processing are all necessary for multiple text comprehen-sion, students adopting different default stances may rely on these processing paradigms to varying extents"
"Speciﬁ- cally, students with a disengaged default stance toward textaccess may primarily engage in skimming, quickly scan-ning sources to ﬁnd a text-explicit answer"
Those adoptingeither an affectively engaged or an evaluative default stancemay be prone to surface-level reading
Students with strongaffective engagement may read texts to accumulate infor-mation of interest to them
"Students with evaluative habits may process texts at the surface level, after validating source quality"
"In particular, affectively engaged and evalu-ative proﬁles may best be distinguished by the types ofsources that students access rather than by depth of process-ing evidenced"
"Finally, students adopting a critical analyticdefault stance may be engage in deep-level processing orseek to not only gather information but also work toward acoherent cross-text representation (i.e., cross-textual elabo- ration; Bra /C14ten & Str ømsø, 2011)"
"Substantial differences have been found in the extent to which students engage in sourcing (i.e.,accessing and considering texts’ document information).Nevertheless, consensus seems to be that students engagein sourcing infrequently and rarely without explicit prompt-ing (Britt & Aglinskas, 2002; Gerjets, Kammerer, & Werner, 2011; List et al., 2017; Stadtler & Bromme, 2007)"
"The CAEM suggests that whether students access a text’sdocument information is contingent on their default stance.Students adopting an evaluative or critical analytic defaultstance may be expected to frequently engage in sourcing,with students adopting the other two proﬁles much lessinclined to do so"
"Those students holding an evaluativedefault stance toward text engagement may access docu- ment information only to make general determinations of text trustworthiness (e.g., to reduce the volume of informa-tion they have to consider; Mason, Boldrin, & Ariasi,2010)"
Students adopting a critical analytic default stancetoward multiple text use may be likely to attend to the docu-ment information in order to ascertain which sources to190 LIST AND ALEXANDER
"trust and to reconcile discrepancies across texts (Britt et al., 1999; Wineburg, 1991)"
"Theories of multiple text use have separated students’ accessing of document information and its incorporationinto an intertext model from the use of this information intext integration (i.e., documents model construction; Brittet al., 1999; Perfetti et al., 1999; Rouet & Britt, 2011)"
"Inthe CAEM, this disjuncture may be understood in terms of motivational factors"
"For example, students adopting an evaluative default stance may routinely access documentinformation"
"However, making use of this document infor-mation in support of multiple text comprehension and inte-gration requires an added level of motivation, such as thatexhibited by students adopting a critical analytic defaultstance toward text access"
Few models have speciﬁed what may cause students’ multiple text use to cease
Considering the default stances students adoptallows us to speculate about these factors
"For example, forstudents adopting a disengaged default stance, text uselikely concludes once a minimally sufﬁcient task response is identiﬁed"
Students exhibiting an affectively engaged default stance might well persist until their topic interest issatiated
"Alternately, for students adopting this type ofdefault stance, cessation may come about through satura- tion(i.e., satiation or when text access is exhaustive such that any additional information gained from texts is redun-dant with information already accumulated)"
"For students holding an evaluative default stance, source access may be rule based and reﬂective of a preference for reliable vis- /C18a-vis unreliable texts"
"Students adopting an evaluative default stance may cease source use either whenall the reliable texts available have been accessed or whensome predetermined number of texts have been consulted(e.g., verifying information across two sources)"
"In eithercase, cessation occurs when students reach a thresholdnumber of quality sources (i.e., standards-based cessation)"
"Finally, students adopting a critical analytic stance may cease their access only once the expected cognitive prod-ucts have been successfully achieved"
"For instance, text usemay continue until conceptual understanding is achieved(i.e., cessation through conceptual resolution)"
"Shift in Default Stance Although the CAEM describes students as adopting default stances toward multiple text use prior to text engagement, the consistency or stability of these assumed stances throughout text use remains an empirical question"
It seemslikely that shifts in default stance can well occur duringtask performance
"For instance, students who are initiallydisengaged may become more interested in the topic of atask, transitioning to adopt a more affectively engageddefault stance"
"Conversely, students initially adopting an evaluative default stance may determine that holding suchan orientation is overly taxing and, as a consequence, maymove to being more disengaged"
"Likewise, evaluative learners may shift to a more task- satisﬁcing approach if they recognize that the texts they areencountering are noncontroversial, representing a generalconsensus on an issue, and therefore do not require particu- lar scrutiny (Braasch et al., 2012)"
Shifts away from or toward a critical analytic default stance may be less likelyto occur
"This form of engagement requires and is sup-ported by both affective factors and evaluative habits.These may reinforce one another, such that students aremotivated by both their interest in the topic of the task andthe process of evaluating texts and resolving discrepanciesfor deep understanding, itself a cognitively motivating experience (Kintsch, 1998)"
"Task Performance As depicted in Figure 1, the CAEM may be considered to specify multiple source use up to the cessation of textengagement"
"Yet, often times, an assigned multiple sourceuse task requires not only cognitive gains to result fromtext access but also for these gains to manifest on measures of text-based task performance"
It may be expected that students’ assumed default stance and resulting text engage-ment lead to differences in performance
"In the sectionsthat follow we consider how the default stances that stu-dents adopt may result in performance differences on com-mon multiple text task outcome measures (i.e., text recall,integration, changes within the individual)"
"Recall has commonly been used as a text- based performance measure (Bra /C14ten et al., 2011; Duggan & Payne, 2011; Salmer /C19on, Gil, Bra/C14ten, & Str ømsø, 2010; Symons & Pressley, 1993)"
Students varying in the defaultstances they adopt might well perform differently on meas-ures of text recall
Students with a disengaged default stance may demonstrate the lowest level of text recall
"Con- versely, those who are affectively engaged may be expectedto recall the most information from texts"
"Driven by inter-est, these students are more prone to gather and retain infor-mation (i.e., slotting; Anderson et al., 1977), although notnecessarily in a conceptually organized manner"
Studentsadopting an evaluative default stance could possibly be dis-tinguishable by their strong recall of document information and their ability to accurately associate speciﬁc content with its source
"Similarly, those students assuming a criticalanalytic default stance may be expected to have high levelsof recall for both text information and document informa-tion and to recall that information in an organized and inte-grated fashion.COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT MODEL 191"
"In a number of studies, students’ multiple text integration has likewise been examined as a higherlevel performance outcome"
"Integration has been assessedby asking students to recognize sentences accurately orinaccurately formed through combining information pre-sented across two or more sources (e.g., Bra /C14ten, Str ømsø,& Britt, 2009; Bra/C14ten, Str ømsø, & Salmer /C19on, 2011) or by evaluating students’ writing (e.g., Britt & Aglinskas, 2002; Rouet, Britt, Mason, & Perfetti, 1996; Wiley & Voss, 1999)"
"For students adopting a disengaged default stancetoward multiple text use, performance on measures of inte-gration and evidence of integration in writing would pre-sumably be quite limited"
"Likewise, although studentsadopting an affectively engaged default stance may beexpected to perform well on assessments of text recall, theyare unlikely to put forth the cognitive effort necessary to reconcile discrepancies across texts"
"Students adopting an evaluative default stance may be expected to associate information in texts with documentinformation and may even corroborate information acrosssources, but they may not truly engage in the conﬂict identi-ﬁcation and resolution processes necessary for true multipletext integration"
"For instance, this may manifest in students appropriately citing sources when writing and even identi- fying point of concurrence across texts but being otherwiselimited in composing integrated responses that acknowl-edge and address points of discrepancy"
"This has been evi-denced in students’ tendencies to simply ignore conﬂictsarising across texts, rather than engaging in the more effort-ful processes associated with reconciliation or conﬂict reso-lution (Stadtler & Bromme, 2014)"
"Indeed, the presence of reconciliation and integration may be among the distin- guishing features in the responses of students adopting acritical analytic default stance toward text access"
"Besides recall and inte- gration, a third type of outcome, typically assumed in stud-ies involving multiple texts, occurs within the learner,independent of response formulation"
"Speciﬁcally, as a con-sequence of engagement with multiple texts, students may learn new information, resulting not only in knowledge addition but also potentially in knowledge revision or atti-tude change"
"For example, learners reading a number oftexts on the topic of climate change may not only come toknow more about this topic (i.e., knowledge addition) but,as a result, may start to consider energy conservation to bean important policy issue (i.e., attitude change), ultimatelyresulting in activism or other behavioral change"
"The CAEM offers a limited number of insights regarding how particular changes in knowledge or attitudes may arise.Nevertheless, we may expect that students adopting anaffectively engaged default stance toward text access mayincrease their interest or strengthen their attitudes as a con-sequence of multiple text access"
"In the attitude literature,this has been termed attitude polarization , referring to a strengthening of learners’ attitudes as a result of encounter-ing attitude-consistent information (Boysen & Vogel, 2007;Kardash & Scholes, 1996; McCrudden & Sparks, 2014)"
"Incontrast, knowledge or attitude revision may be expected toresult only from the deep processing associated with a criti-cal analytic stance toward text access"
"PARAMETERS OF THE CAEM After introducing CAEM components, we want to deﬁne the scope of this model and outline the aspects of multiple text use it seeks to explain"
In the last sections of this articlewe explicitly discuss advantages of the CAEM relative toother models of multiple text use and CAEM limitations
We acknowledge that no model—including the CAEM—can account for all possible cognitive or motiva-tional factors relevant to multiple text processing
"Thatbeing said, parameters of the CAEM were developed in ref- erence to how multiple text use has commonly been investi- gated"
"In general, studies of multiple text use can becharacterized as presenting students with (a) an assignedtaskand (b) a library of multiple texts upon which to draw"
"Commonly, these texts have been (c) controversial in nature and have required students to produce (d) external products as evidence of text processing"
We address each of these four characteristics to delineate the type of multiple text use the CAEM seeks to explain
"Task Investigations of multiple text use typically examine students’ interactions with texts in response to an assignedtask (e.g., Anmarkrud, McCrudden, Bra /C14ten, & Str ømsø, 2013; Cerd /C19an & Vidal-Abarca, 2008; Wiley & Voss, 1999)"
"Indeed, in much work, a particular task assignment hasbeen considered to be the initiating event for multiple textuse (Rouet & Britt, 2011)"
The CAEM likewise acknowl-edges task as an important factor guiding learners’ engage- ment with multiple texts
"Speciﬁcally, the CAEM seeks to explain students’ multiple text use in response to tasks thatmay be characterized as open-ended, that is, tasks that poseageneral purpose for students’ text processing (McCrud- den & Schraw, 2007), such as forming an argument, arriv-ing at a decision, or justifying an opinion"
"These open-ended tasks are not ones that require a single, objectivelycorrect response; rather they allow for a wide variety of responses to be potentially valid, presuming they reﬂect the comprehension; integration; and, if need be, corroborationof information across texts"
"At the same time, due to itsfocus on the affective factors guiding multiple text use, theCAEM also describes learners’ text processing as reﬂectinggeneral motivational inclinations (e.g., interest in or192 LIST AND ALEXANDER"
curiosity about a topic) that operate regardless of whether tasks are assigned to students or are learner generated
"Multiple Texts At the most basic level, studies of multiple text use have been deﬁned merely by the presence of multiple sourcesintroduced to students as part of a designated task (e.g., Bra /C14ten et al., 2009; List et al., 2017; Rouet et al., 1996)"
"The need for multiple texts most commonly arises when students elect to or are assigned to investigate complexissues for which no single source may be expected tohave all of the requisite information (Britt et al., 2013).Descriptions of text access in the CAEM are likewisepredicated on learners having access to or being pre-sented with multiple sources of information, such thatth ei nfo rm at io nne ede dt ores olv eat as ki sd is tr ib ut ed across sources, distinctly attr ibuted or differing in format"
"Controversy The literature on multiple text use, in recognition of the dubious quality of some of the information on the Internetand the complex nature of knowledge in today’s societies(Coiro, 2003; Goldman & Scardamalia, 2013), has carefully and purposefully selected information sources for students to draw upon during task completion"
"These have typicallyvaried in trustworthiness (Bra /C14ten et al., 2011; Bra/C14ten et al., 2009; Kammerer & Gerjets, 2012) and have been deliber-ately assembled to present conﬂicting views on controver-sial topics, like climate change or genetically modiﬁed food(Kienhues, Stadtler, & Bromme, 2011; Rouet et al., 1996;Thomm & Bromme, 2016; Wiley & Voss, 1999)"
"Even though motivation and affect have not been explicitly addressed in these studies, there has been the expectationthat controversy or conﬂict between texts would stimulatelearners’ engagement and result in more deliberate and stra-tegic processing (Anmarkrud, Bra /C14ten, & Str ømsø, 2014)"
The CAEM adopts a broader lens on multiple text com- prehension and integration
"Speciﬁcally, the CAEMattempts to explain learners’ interactions with multiple texts regardless of their comparative trustworthiness, whether the information presented across texts is consistent, comple-mentary, or conﬂicting in nature, or whether it underscoresor contradicts students’ existing knowledge and attitudes.The CAEM proposes that even the most straightforwardmultiple text task, involving concordant texts of compara-ble trustworthiness, demands that learners engage a host ofhigher level cognitive processes to achieve integration"
"Such processes include multiple text navigation and the management of information load (Amadieu, Tricot, & Mar-in/C19e, 2010; Madrid, van Oostendorp, & Melguizo, 2009; Rouet & Britt, 2011) and information synthesis and organi-zation (e.g., determining relevance, identifying relationsacross texts; Afﬂerbach & Cho, 2009; Bra /C14ten & Str ømsø,2011; Rouet & Le Bigot, 2007; Wolfe & Goldman, 2005)"
"As such, multiple text comprehension and integration, ofany form, may be considered a demanding process thatrequires a considerable degree of motivation or effort onthe part of learners"
"Although required when texts are consistent with one another, motivation and multiple text use skills become allthe more necessary when students must resolve disagree- ments across texts or revise their own understanding"
"This type of reconciliation or knowledge revision requires thatstudents engage a host of additional processing skills, suchas corroboration and evaluation (Stadtler & Bromme, 2014;Stadtler, Scharrer, Brummernhenrich, & Bromme, 2013;Wolfe & Goldman, 2005)"
"Although reconciliation may beconsidered a more demanding process than the synthesis ofmultiple texts (Barzilai, Tzadok, & Eshet-Alkalai, 2015; Britt et al., 1999), students’ reasoning about multiple texts is, nevertheless, uniformly conceptualized in the CAEM asthe joint consequence of motivation and skillfulengagement"
"External Products Within this literature, resea rchers have assessed multiple text comprehension and inte gration in a variety of ways, through students’ responses both to objectively scored questions and to writing prompts (Bra /C14ten et al., 2009; Cerd /C19an & Vidal-Abarca, 2008; Wiley & Voss, 1999)"
"Typically, these assessments have resulted in the devel-opment of a physical product (e.g., a written response)thought to correspond to the multiple-text representa-tions readers cognitively construct (Britt et al., 1999).The CAEM, likewise, focuses on the cognitive outcomes of text access (termed cognitive products ) and considersho wt hes em a yb ere ﬂ ec te di ns tudents’ performance on multiple text tasks"
"Moreover, due to its motivationalfocus, the CAEM recognizes that noncognitive productsshould likewise result as an outcome of text access.These include learners’ increased interest in a topic orattitudinal change"
"Justiﬁcation for the CAEM Motivational and skill-based aspects of text processinge nc omp as se di nth eC AE Mar eno tun iqu et om ult i pl etext comprehension; they apply to single text reading aswell (e.g., Guthrie & Wigﬁeld, 1999)"
"Nevertheless, theCAEM is a model speciﬁc to multiple text comprehen-sion and integration"
"First, multiple text processing presents unique informa- tional, cognitive, and motivational demands for students,required to process a much larger volume of informa-tion, integrate that informati on, and engage in evaluative processes to a much more deliberate extent (Rouet,2006)"
"single text processing is associated with a focus on how students comprehend not onlyt raditional print texts but also texts in new, multimedia formats and in novel, digi-tal contexts (Bra /C14ten, Braasch, & Salmer /C19on, 2016; Gold- man et al., 2010)"
"A feature of these digital contexts isthat they require students to engage skills associatedwith effective multiple text use (e.g., strategic naviga-tion, source evaluation) to an even greater extent and to be all the more motivated to do so, particularly in the face of challenge (Coiro, 2003; Dalton & Proctor, 2008;Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004)"
"Across printand digital contexts, the CAEM is focused on under- standing the skills, strategies, habits, and motivationalstores, and their interactions, that impact students’engagement with and integration of multiple texts"
"CAEM ADVANTAGES The CAEM draws on both behaviorally and cognitively ori- ented models of multiple source use (e.g., Britt et al., 2013;Britt et al., 1999; Rouet, 2006)"
"However, as a point ofdeparture, the CAEM argues that multiple text engagementmay best be understood in terms of students’ motivationalorientations toward a task or topic and habits with regard to source evaluation"
The CAEM offers a number of advan- tages relative to extant models
"Like behavioral models, the CAEM understands mul- tiple source use to unfold thr ough a series of text-proc- essing actions (e.g., text se lection, accessing document information)"
"However, in classifying students’ textengagement according to default stances, the CAEMprovides a framework whereby text use behaviors can be differentiated and explained in terms of students’ motivation and habits with re gard to text evaluation"
"For instance, although existing mod els identify source selec- tion as a key behavior within the larger process of mul-tiple source use (e.g., Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis, &Vermetten, 2005; Britt et al., 2013), the CAEM offerspotential insights into why some students may elect toaccess many texts and others only a few, even when responding to the same task"
"Further, by examining students’ source use as gui ded by a default stance, seemingly independent behaviors (e.g., source selection,evaluation) can be interpreted and uniﬁed through acommon framework"
A key distinction between existing models and the CAEM is their treatment of topic
"Although many modelshave conceptualized multiple text use as functioning in sim- ilar ways across domains, the CAEM suggests that students’ engagement with a particular topic is a strongdeterminant of high-level cognitive processing and perfor-mance"
"Further, the CAEM’s focus on task topic alongsidestudents’ skills in source evaluation provides a frameworkfor examining domain-speciﬁc text engagement, as hasbeen explored in early studies of multiple text use (Wine- burg, 1991)"
"In positioning students’ evaluative skills and habits as central to effective multiple source use, in conjunction withmotivation, the CAEM is able to account for a wide rangeof performance outcomes"
"In instances where students’ per-formance has been found to differ across tasks, the CAEMexplains such discrepancies as a function of motivation or lack thereof"
"In cases where students perform consistently poorly, limitations in source use skills may be to blame"
"Assuch, the CAEM serves as an umbrella framework toexplain the variation in multiple source use task perfor-mance documented across studies (Goldman et al., 2012).More generally, the CAEM offers at least seven keyinsights regarding the nature of students’ engagement withmultiple texts: 1"
"While students have general approaches to multi- ple text access, based on their habituated multipletext use skills, they may engage these to greater or lesser extents, depending on task- and topic-speciﬁc factors"
Multiple text use is a complex process requiring stu- dents to be both motivated and affectively engaged and to possess habituated skills in source evaluation
Students’ affective engagement with a particular topic or motivation is central to high-level text proc-essing or multiple text integration
"In many cases, students’ approaches to text use may be classiﬁed as disengaged or restricted in motivation and skill use"
There are key qualitative differences among students’ manife st source use behaviors
"Various source use behaviors may be understood as relatedto one another and as arising, systematically, fromdifferences in students’ orientations toward multi-ple texts"
"Across tasks, students may shift the default stances they adopt in prescribed ways, based on their habits with regard to source evaluation and interest in par-ticular topics"
"FURTHER DIRECTIONS Despite the advantages of the CAEM over other models of multiple source use and the insights garnered, there are sev- eral avenues of research that need to be pursued"
"The ave- nues identiﬁed here are not intended to be a comprehensivelist, as presently much of the CAEM is only conceptuallydeﬁned and therefore speculative"
"Indeed, each componentof the model requires further theoretical speciﬁcation andempirical support.194 LIST AND ALEXANDER"
