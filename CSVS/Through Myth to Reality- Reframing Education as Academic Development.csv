"In effect, they would likely see an educational experience oriented toward test performance rather than toward learning or stu - dent development"
"For many educational experts, the level of investment that American society now makes in identifying and assessing academic benchmarks or content stan - dards is almost incomprehensible"
"It is also the mounting emotional, educational, and socio - political costs that come with this unhealthy obsession with the quantification of school achievement"
"If we probe deeper into this testing mania, we find that thereare good intentions at its core—a well-meaning search for evidence that we aretruly “educating” the future citizenry of our country"
"Yet many within the educa - tional research community, as well as in the public at large, believe that the costs of the accountability movement have far outstripped any academic benefits thatmight be realized (Abedi, 2004; Feinberg, 1988)"
"Those railing against Public Law107-110, commonly known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), and other manifes-tations of the accountability movement perceive such efforts as significant barriersto the attainment of educational goals—goals that include producing a populacewith a hunger for knowledge, the ability to reflect deeply on critical issues, and theskills to deal effectively with the many demands of a complex and rapidly chang-ing world made more accessible as a result of a technological revolution (Alexan-der et al., in press)"
"On whichever side of the sociopolitical or educational spectrum one falls with regard to this controversial issue of accountability, there remains the often sharedperception that the current state of education is far from optimal"
"Thus, althoughmany rally around the belief that schooling is not adequately serving the needs ofall segments of the school population, there is no agreed-upon course of action.Educational researchers cannot place themselves above this fray, either"
Weshould not be shocked that those in political and public arenas talk almost obses - sively about benchmarks or standards or rely on questionable measures to docu - ment students’ achievements
"What coherent or comprehensive models have we placed at the feet of the public orthe policymakers, who, I must believe, also want the best for our children andyouth"
"Indeed, my reaction to Robert Gagné’s (1977) intriguing questions that opened this discussion is that we still know far too little about the optimal course of learnerdevelopment across the lifespan and about the anticipated changes that occur inthose on that journey"
"As the contributors to this special issue rightly acknowledge,research has demonstrated that those who face educational difficulties are also aptto suffer physically, socially, and emotionally (e.g., Hughes & Zhang, 2007; Lohr,Teglasi, & French, 2004; Teglasi, Cohn, & Meshbesher, 2004)"
But the educa - tional concerns addressed herein extend well beyond identified populations strug -634 ALEXANDER
"They are pertinent to all members of the classroom community, even those who appear to be negotiating the academic de - mands of formal education adequately"
This special issue is an occasion to initiate an interdisciplinary dialogue about the interface between cognitive and socioemotional competences within schoolsettings and to consider how current educational goals and pedagogical practicesinfluence the co-development of such competencies
"If there is to be some reason - able alternative to the test obsession that now marks the formal educational sys - tem, one that values learning over test performance, then it must come from those with the theoretical and methodological knowledge and the commitment to engagein extended interdisciplinary research"
It must come from a consortium of individ - uals like those contributing to this special issue
"Therefore, let me throw down the gauntlet to this scholarly assemblage to commit to the systematic, multidis - ciplinary, and multidimensional study of the formal educational experience and the cognitive and socioemotional changes that this experience should ideallyevoke—what I have labeled academic development (Alexander, 2000, 2006; Al- exander, Schallert, & Reynolds, 2009; Alexander, Sperl, Buehl, Fives, & Chiu,2004)"
"I first coined the term academic development in my theoretical and empirical writings precisely because no more suitable label for the multifaceted nature of hu-man growth and development could be found (e.g., Alexander, 2000)"
"Although Iuse the word academic , I wish to assuage any fears that I am dealing with school- ing in narrow cognitive terms"
"Rather, the descriptor academic signals the conflu- ence of cognitive, social, emotional, motivational, and cultural factors that con-tribute to optimal student development within the context of formal education"
"Specifically, as a way to explicate and justify this new concept of academic de - velopment, my intentions are threefold"
"First, I want to expose several significant myths that presently plague the educational experience and that act as barriers tothe worthwhile goals of this special issue"
"Those myths include the mistaken beliefthat achievement, as defined by high-stakes testing, equates to learning, when, infact, such an excessive focus can be detrimental to lifelong, meaningful learning.The needs of students are better served when more time and attention is devoted toconcepts and processes held as central to academic domains, what has been termedprincipled knowledge (Alexander, Murphy, & Woods, 1997; Gelman & Greeno, 1989)"
"There are also the myths that mentioning (i.e., “covering the content”)equates to teaching and that the purpose of education is clear"
"Second, I hope to convince readers that there is much to be gained when educa - tion is viewed as a developmental process rather than a year-by-year, course- by-course treatment of instructional content"
This developmental orientation couldhelp to amplify the degree to which a learner’s academic development is muchmore than a coldly cognitive act of accumulating factual tidbits
the continual interplay of cognitive and motivational/emotional forces operating within a dynamic sociocultural context
"Third, one of the advantages that comes with viewing formal education as a de - velopmental process is that this orientation could potentially lessen the emphasis on immediate or short-term educational gains and promote contemplation of themore enduring and long-term effects of instructional or curricular decisions"
I donot wish to suggest that there are no merits to the examination of more short-termoutcomes; there are
"However, these more “immediate” gains must be consideredin relation to what they suggest about long-term growth and development"
"For ex - ample, do we want to risk stifling students’ interest in reading by immersing them in a “drill-and-practice” phonics curriculum devoid of stimulating literature, orrisk turning “struggling readers” into “struggling thinkers” by failing to teach themto think critically and intensively about what they read or hear"
"I would think not.To support this contention, I will share my specific approach to the study of learn - ers’ academic development and the theoretical and methodological insights and challenges that this research program has revealed"
"That theoretical and empiricalprogram centers on the model of domain learning (MDL; Alexander, 1997), whichis an attempt to examine the paths of knowledge, strategic processing, and interestas they interact and intertwine across the lifespan as learners journey toward com-petence or even expertise in academic domains"
"Before I delve into educational myths that interfere with the pursuit of aca- demic development, I want to share briefly my personal journey to the realizationthat the very construct of academic development needed to be introduced into theeducational vernacular"
"Specifically, over the past 25 years, I have been aggres-sively engaged in the theoretical and empirical study of human learning"
That pur-suit was a natural outgrowth of my years as a private and public school teacher
"Aswith many in my profession, I chose to become a teacher for altruistic reasons—tohelp students realize their potential through formal education"
"Although I consid - ered myself very effective in this honorable profession, I knew that I had much to learn if those altruistic goals were ever to be realized to the level I envisioned"
"Thus, I enrolled in a doctoral program in which I found myself enamored with educational research and the potential it held for illuminating the path toward im - proved learning for all who crossed the threshold into the realm of formal educa - tion"
"Indeed, I learned much about what was required for students like those I had taught to progress not only in their academics but also in their everyday lives.One of the most important lessons that I learned, however, was that complexproblems like academic development require multidisciplinary problem solving.Even the most gifted teachers or the most forward-thinking educational psychol - ogists cannot hope to bring students to the pinnacle of their academic potential"
"The problem is not simply instructional, cognitive, motivational, or socio - political"
This is the theme of this issue and of this notion of aca - demic development.636 ALEXANDER
"EDUCATIONAL MYTHS How does one explain how or why certain activities, ideas, or beliefs initially take root within the individual mind or the public conscience, becoming commonplace,routine, or pervasive in character, whereas other comparable activities, ideas, orbeliefs lie fallow or languish"
"Ideally, one would hope that a deciding factor be - tween those notions that are ultimately embraced and those that are discredited or discarded would be the credibility or strength of supporting evidence"
"Sadly, evena cursory examination of wildly popular fads (e.g., text-messaging while driving,bungee jumping) or shared social practices (e.g., overeating on holidays, living oncredit) offers sufficient refutation of this ideal state"
It is not only the general popu - lace that finds questionable ideas or practices attractive or irresistible
The same tendency can be documented among educational researchers and practitioners whohold passionately to underlying assumptions or favored interventions that are un - tested or run counter to the prevailing evidence
"There is even reason to question what some educators or educational researchers regard as “evidence” in support offavored approaches or emergent interventions, but that issue lies outside the scopeof the current discussion"
"Perhaps like others within the educational community, I have harbored the somewhat impish urge to stand up in a public forum and shout “The emperor hasno clothes!” when I encounter these seemingly unwarranted claims or perceptions.Further, I feel strongly that those within the educational research community havean obligation to call the public’s attention to seemingly widespread beliefs or per-ceptions that, at a minimum, demand closer inspection"
It is also essential to turnthat critical eye inward to scrutinize certain popular conceptions that appear withinthe educational discourse
"I want to expose whatI perceive as insidious educational myths that have been allowed to take root andspread within the realms of public perception and political decision making,maybe even reaching into sectors of the educational community"
These are beliefsthat cannot continue to infiltrate individual minds or public conscience without theprotection that comes with healthy skepticism or reasonable doubt
"Specifically, I want to discuss six educational myths that I contend are alive and well within public and political arenas—myths that have not been successfully dis - pelled and that, therefore, continue to exert tremendous influence on funded edu - cational research and mandated educational practices"
"Achievement on High-Stakes Tests Equals Learning The first myth that I want to expose is the belief that the word achievement , which has come to represent performance on high-stakes tests, equates to the concept oflearning"
"In fact, I have arguedelsewhere that effective education requires effective assessment (Alexander, 2006;ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT 637"
"Alexander & Riconscente, 2005), which is defined as the “process of obtaining information that is used to make educational decisions about students, to givefeedback to the student about his or her progress, strengths, weaknesses, to judgeinstructional effectiveness and curricular adequacy, and to inform policy” (Ameri - can Federation of Teachers, National Council of Measurement in Education, & National Educational Association, 1990,p"
"But tests are merely one aspect ofassessment, and tests that result in reliable and valid data are, at best, only mean - ingful samplings of students’ knowledge and capabilities"
"Consequently, when the educational system relies solely or almost exclusively on high-stakes tests to es - tablish the worth of its teachers, the effectiveness of its schools, or the attainment of its students, the potential merits of assessment are misunderstood"
This tendency to equate performance on high-stakes assessments with learning is problematic for a number of other reasons
It portrays education as a series ofdiscrete hurdles to be cleared rather than as an ongoing journey to be relished
"Inaddition, it is all about the “ends” and not the “means.” That is, test performance isthe goal—not the understanding or knowledge that such tests are sampling"
"In es-sence, this orientation colors academic content as information to be garnered inservice of performance, not as knowledge to be sought for personal fulfillment.Further, linking learning to high-stakes tests may promote performance avoidanceversus mastery orientation (Harackiewicz, Barron, & Elliot, 1998; Linnenbrink,2005)"
That means that students work to avoid failure rather than seek to under-stand and master valued academic content
It is about what they do at that pointon a select measure
How far one has progressed or future academic/personal goalsdo not enter into the equation
"Finally, this orientation toward education is “coldlycognitive” (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993)"
It overlooks critical strategic and mo - tivational factors that are central to academic development
"Of course, it might be argued that the compulsion to let the test drive curriculum may not theoretically be a justifiable decision but that from a practical standpoint itmakes sense, since it would seem to ensure that students at least learn the contentthat is flagged by those tests—the very argument put forth by former PresidentGeorgeW"
The problem is that the empirical evidence brings even that argu - ment into question
"For example, an experiment by Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, and Kauffman (1982) showed that students working with teachers who were in - structed to facilitate learning employed more strategies associated with higher aca - demic attainment did better than students whose teachers were told to focus on test standards"
"Several years later, Flink, Boggiano, and Barrett (1990) replicated andextended those findings"
"study, teachers told to en - sure that their students perform well on target measures manifested more control - ling instructional strategies and had lower student performance than teachers di - rected to facilitate student learning"
"Still other data suggest the flaws inherent in the “teach to the test” curricular mentality (e.g., Grolnick & Ryan, 1987; Ryan &638 ALEXANDER"
It is not only the students who suffer in the current high-stakes test climate
"For ex - ample, Emmet Rosenfeld (2004), a former teacher in Virginia, brought the poten - tial side effects of this test obsession to reality as he discussed the negative influ - ence that the state’s Standards of Learning had on his career: Standards of Learning were introduced to make education better"
"The intense pressure to raise test scores eventually squeezed the life out of school, both for my kids and for me.… I no longer loved myjob; at least, I didn’t want to spend the rest of my professional career teaching to astandardized test"
"20) Accountability Is About Improving Students’ Learning Although I am focusing on the current obsession with high-stakes testing, I want to deal with another myth that interferes with students’ academic development.Throughout the public and political discourse about educational reform, the notionof “accountability” is often conjured as some elixir to heal current ailments"
"Whenaccountability is so voiced, it is typically in terms of educational administrators orclassroom teachers who must be held responsible for their students’ performanceon state and national assessments"
"Implicit in this rhetoric is the assumption thatthis stress on state, district, or school administrators’ or teachers’ accountabilitywill contribute to improved student learning"
"In effect, this presumption amounts to a “trickle-down” philosophy of educa- tional reform"
But does such a belief hold up under scrutiny—or is this just anotherinstance of educational mythology
"At the very least, we must acknowledge thatthis persistent emphasis on accountability stands as a symbol of public and politi - cal distrust with the educational system and educational professionals"
"In effect, since we cannot trust educational professionals to work for improved studentlearning, we must hold threats over their heads to ensure compliance"
Such an“overseer mentality” dismisses the power of positive reinforcers and rewards toencourage individuals to work under challenging conditions or with learners ingreatest need
"Where are the social, motivational, and financial incentives forthose who consider entering one of the most challenging and significant profes - sions"
All stick and no carrot! Not much of a motivational plan to recruit outstand - ing candidates into the teaching profession
"Another dimension of this accountability myth is mirrored in the unit of analy - sis central to educational legislation, such as NCLB"
"If accountability were truly about improved student learning over the course of the educational experience,then we would expect the data that come from high-stakes tests to be directly rele - vant to the identification and service of individual students’ academic strengths and needs"
"Indeed, if there was more diagnostic merit to these high-stakes tests atACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT 639"
"the level of the individual learner, and if there was more focus on deeper process - ing and more complex thinking, then there would be more reason to devote educa - tional time and money to their development and implementation"
"Yet beyond summative judgments of whether students pass or fail, graduate or not, the unit ofanalysis on which programmatic, accountability, and instructional decisions arebased has little to do with individual student learning and development"
"To support this contention, Michelle Riconscente and I examined the language of NCLB to test our hypothesis that the focus was not on learners but on teachersand schools (Alexander & Riconscente, 2005) and that phrases such as “high-achieving schools,” “low-performing schools,” or “schools that excel” dot the leg - islative landscape"
"What we determined in our discourse analysis was that the NCLB legislation used the word “school” almost 4,000 times"
"In fact, “individual”was used 10 times less and “student” showed up at half the frequency of “school” orits variants in this legislation"
"Regrettably, we must not lose sight of the fundamentalfact that schools do not learn"
"Clearly, there is a confounding of measures of overall schoolachievement with those of individual students in the educational mythology"
"However, the choice of assessment must be commensurate with the goals of that assess-ment since certain indicators have value in particular contexts or for certain tasksor student populations but not others (Mislevy, 1994; Pellegrino, Chudowsky, &Glaser, 2001)"
"High-stakes assessments that measure broad content knowledgeare often ineffective tools for diagnosing student learning or guiding instruc - tional decision making (Braun & Mislevy, 2004)"
"When the academic develop - ment of students moves to the foreground, the characteristics of those students, along with features of the task and the context, are raised to a higher status,thereby allowing for more valid inferences about learning (Baxter, Elder, &Glaser, 1996; Mislevy, 1994)"
"Mentioning Equals Teaching Even in the pre-NCLB days, when I was teaching public school, I remember the pressure to cover the content, that is, the feeling that I had to ensure that my stu - dents were at least exposed to all the knowledge and skills specified in the district’s scope and sequence chart"
Covering the content haslong been de rigueur for practicing teachers required to deal with far too much content in far too short a time span
"Moreover, I remain greatly concerned that thisdrive to get through the material in today’s classrooms comes at great cost to aca -640 ALEXANDER"
"Like many educators, it had not occurred to me that this men - tioning was a poor proxy for the teaching of which I knew I was capable"
Men - tioning simply does not allow teachers or their students to delve deeply and meaningfully into important academic content
It is Dolores Durkin (1978–1979) who is credited with coining the term men- tioning 
"Durkin, investigating the deplorable lack of comprehension instruction, referred to mentioning as the superficial treatment of essential concepts and strate - gies"
"Viewed in this manner, mentioning may promote an “illusion of teaching” among educators, as well as an “illusion of learning” on the part of students (Alex - ander & Knight, 1993)"
"Thus, educators must recognize that even repeated men - tioning of key academic content does not ensure that learning will occur"
"That is why others have called for teaching more about less (diSessa, 1993)"
This counter - point to mentioning (which entails teaching less and less about more and more) may allow educators the time they need to teach
"However, it does not address thefundamental question of what content ultimately merits such valuable instruc - tional focus"
"To do that one must ascertain the underlying principles that define disciplines and domains and determine how those foundational principles can beintroduced, honed, and elaborated over the course of students’ academic develop-ment"
Such principles are much more foundational understand-ings than the multitude of concepts and skills that constitute typical schoolcurricula
"These principles are, in effect, the premises that define a domain or dis-cipline and distinguish it from yet another domain or discipline"
"For instance, edu-cational experiences should assist students to understand the nature of historicalthinking and facilitate their capacity to gather and analyze relevant historical evi-dence (Maggioni, VanSledright, & Alexander, 2009)"
"They should also supportstudents’ acquisition of the strategies required to pose and test hypotheses aboutthe physical world in science and to interrogate texts while reading in order toachieve a deep comprehension of the encrypted message (Alexander et al., inpress; Fox & Alexander, 2009)"
Effective Education Will Eliminate Student Differences Another persistent belief that works against the realization of academic develop - ment is the myth that effective education can somehow eliminate learner differ - ences
I first became aware of this myth as a new assistant professor
"At a college meeting, a well-intentioned administrator came to the podium to share departmen - tal initiatives"
"In the excitement of the moment, this individual stated that his de - partment’s professional development activities would succeed in leveling the aca - demic playing field for allstudents"
"The implication of his message was that the better the instruction, the more equality in student learning and achievement wouldbe evidenced"
get started that great education would bring about academic parity at the level of the individual student
"Sadly, it is not just this one well-intentioned but misguidedprofessor who gives credence to the myth that effective education will eliminateindividual differences"
"Before I proceed, let me clarify that I am talking about the mythology surround - ingindividual differences, not group differences"
"There is every reason to view the disparity between particular groups as real and unacceptable (Lee, 2002)"
"How - ever, the rhetoric does not stop at the group but permeates to the level of the indi - vidual learner"
"Consider the following excerpt from NCLB ( Public Law 107-110 , 2001)"
"In the Statement of Purpose, it is claimed that NCLB’s purpose of ensuringthat “all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain ahigh-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging Stateacademic achievement standards and state academic assessments” (p"
"15) can beaccomplished by “closing the achievement gap between high- and low-performingchildren, especially the achievement gaps between minority and nonminority stu - dents, and between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers” (p"
"Thus, even within the federal legislation, there is the notion that effective edu- cation can indeed close “the achievement gap between high- and low-performingchildren,” as the wording of NCLB suggests"
"Despite such well-intentionedphraseology, the reality, I would contend, is to the contrary"
"That is to say, we cannever eliminate individual differences that exist within all groups, be they minority or nonminority, economically advantaged or disadvantaged"
"Moreover, as I arguehere, effective education will not only fail to eliminate differences that exist be-tween learners but will also serve to exacerbate such differences"
"For one, there hasbeen more than a century of research on the variability that exists at the level of theindividual with regard to an array of cognitive, affective, and motivational factorsthat influence student learning"
"Students inevitably bring these differences into theacademic environment, and their effects on learning and development can be tre - mendous"
"Unless human variability can be excised, any expectations of academic “sameness” implied by this myth remain invalid"
Let me again make it clear that Iam not discussing inequities or disparities that currently exist between cultural andsocioeconomic groups
"More to the point, there is reason to assume that effective instruction could po - tentially exacerbate human differences that exist rather than eliminate them"
"This assumption is supported by the research on the Matthew effect (Stanovich, 1986).Keith Stanovich named this effect for its literary reference to Matthew 25:29: “Forunto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from himthat hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” What Stanovich pro - posed is that students who are cognitively, affectively, or motivationally richer get642 ALEXANDER"
"Conversely, those who enter their academic experiences with limited cognitive and motivational re - sources face the prospect of falling further and further behind their more privileged classmates"
"Learning environments will, consequently, not be experienced equallyby students as a consequence of preexisting differences in their knowledge, strate - gic abilities, motivations, and cognitive capabilities"
The individual differences that preexist any educational experience ensure that variability in learning will re - sult from those experiences
The Purpose of Formal Education Is Clear One might assume from the intense concentration of fiscal and human resources on current programmatic and assessment efforts that the most fundamental educa - tional issues—the reason that the social institutions of schools exist and the pur - pose of the formal education they provide—have been resolved
"However, I would argue that either we have failed to weigh these most basic questions orwe have failed to consider that content and processes of current edu- cational practices in light of our beliefs"
The bottom line is the tacit acceptance thatthe purpose of education is clear and well established
"In truth, one might have un-told purposes for participating in formal education"
"For example, is the purpose ofeducation, as Malcolm Forbes (n.d.) stated, to “replace an empty mind with anopen one”"
"Or is it “the progressive discovery of our own ignorance,” as the histo-rian Will Durant (n.d.) so eloquently said"
"Maybe, like John Dewey (1897), oneconceives of education as “a social process … a process of living and not a prepa- ration for future living” (p"
"10), the function of education “is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.” Prophetically, King warned that“education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society.The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no mor - als.” From a more pragmatic and legalistic standpoint, the Supreme Court in Yoderv"
Wisconsin (1972) ruled that the purpose of education is to prevent citizens from becoming a burden on the state
"Yet even from this less lofty vantage point, itwould appear that the educational system has failed for far too many of the popu - lace"
"However, do we see any of these laudable or pragmatic purposes reflected in current educational policies or assessment practices"
"Where is the depth of explo - ration of self or domains of knowledge implied by these declarations (Deci et al., 1982; diSessa, 1993)"
"Where is the concern for thinking intensively or critically(e.g., Alexander et al., in press)"
I see little in the current educational policies and as - sessment that portray a clear educational purpose beyond the acquisition of the most basic skills in threshold domains.ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT 643
"The Social and Motivational Aspects of Education Are Well Understood In their analysis of the research base for the American Psychological Association’s learner-centered principles, Alexander and Murphy (1998) stated that the socio - cultural context and motivational/affective forces play a significant role in stu - dents’ learning and development"
"A wealth of research from social psychology, school psychology, educational psychology, and other fields has established thatmany noncognitive factors that operate in schools and in out-of-school environ - ments can serve to foster or frustrate students’ academic development (Pintrich et al., 1993)"
"For instance, students who have low self-esteem or low efficacy beliefs;students without social supports in school or at home; or students who are bored,disaffected, or generally unengaged cannot be expected to realize their academicpotential (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991)"
"Nonetheless, when we consider the focus ofteacher preparation, policy initiatives, or curricular interventions, it would appearthat the educational experience is largely conceptualized and operationalized as a“coldly cognitive” enterprise (Pintrich et al., 1995 )"
"If academic development is to be fully embraced, it will be critical to address multiple dimensions of students’ lives—from their physical care to their socialwell-being—even as we strive to expand their minds and enrich their knowledgeand cognitive capabilities"
"There should also be systematic consideration of howthe educational experience influences motivational and affective conditions, alongwith the cognitive outcomes that are commonplace"
"For example, there are reasonsto be concerned about the long-term effects of non-engaging reading programs onstudents’ motivations toward reading (Guthrie & Wigfield, 1997) and about agrowing dislike of mathematics that is seemingly associated with “drill-and-kill”pedagogical approaches (Meece, Wigfield, & Eccles, 1990; Middleton & Spanias,1999)"
It is not simply a matter of how noncognitive factors shape students’ learning and development
"How the educational experience influences students socially,culturally, motivationally, and affectively is also of concern"
I wish I could say thatthe centuries of educational research and practice have resulted in a clear picture ofthe cognitive and affective transformations that should occur in students as theyparticipate in the formal educational process
"There is research sug - gesting that motivation begins to wane as students progress through school (Wigfield, Tonks, & Eccles, 2004)"
"Evidence of diminished engagement, in - creased boredom, and learner apathy has also been reported (e.g., Riconscente, 2007)"
"Of course, no one program or intention can hope to do it all"
"The scope andcomplexity of the problem is simply too much for any one empirical study, evenone that is longitudinal in design"
"However, at a minimum, we should expect thatinterventions that speak to academic development at an individual level considernoncognitive variables.644 ALEXANDER"
THE MDL I would like to offer up one modest program of research that I have pursued over the past 10 years and that has sought to investigate academic development in termsof students’ learning in academic domains
"My approach to studying academic de - velopment is the MDL, in which my goal was to document the systematic changes that occur in learners as they progress toward increased competence within recog - nized fields of study (e.g., Alexander, 1997; Alexander, Jetton, & Kulikowich, 1995; Alexander, Murphy, Woods, Duhon, & Parker, 1997; Murphy & Alexander,2002)"
"The interplay between three central constructs (i.e., knowledge, strategicprocessing, and interest), each investigated in two varied forms (i.e., domain andtopic knowledge, surface-level strategies and deep-processing strategies, and indi - vidual interest and situational interest), serves as the backbone of the MDL"
"Based on decades of prior research on these constructs, individually and in combination(e.g., Alexander & Judy, 1988; de Jong & Ferguson-Hessler, 1986; Dewey, 1913;Hidi, 1990), I formulated a model as to what changes should transpire in their in-terrelations should individuals show growth toward increased competence andperhaps even expertise in a specific academic domain"
"Thus, as depicted in Figure 1, it was hypothesized that those in the earliest stage of their domain-specific development (i.e., acclimation) have both limited andfragmented domain (breadth) or topic (depth) knowledge upon which they candraw"
"In part because of the state of their knowledge, students in acclimation alsohave to use many surface-level strategies that allow them to make sense of the do-main-specific problems they confront, and they are less able to delve into deep-processing strategies that allow them to transform or deeply ponder the current sit-uation"
"Furthermore, this lack of rich domain knowledge and the high strategic de - mands are complicated by a lack of deep-seated interest in or personal identifica - tion with the domain or a given domain-specific task (i.e., individual interest)"
"Rather, learners in acclimation rely on features of the task or the context to piquetheir interest and motivate their engagement (i.e., situational interest)"
"If conditions are favorable and the suitable educational experiences are forth - coming, learners can cross the threshold into competence—and thankfully most students who have the benefit of a K–12 education can achieve at least fragile com - petence in most basic academic domains (e.g., reading, mathematics, history)"
"In effect, competence is an extended stage that is marked by quantitative and qualita - tive changes in knowledge, strategic processing, and interest"
"For instance, topic and domain knowledge not only increases, but that knowledge becomes more co - hesive or more principled, which is a hallmark of this stage"
What is also dramatic and related to this quantitative and qualitative shift in domain knowledge withincompetence is that learners manifest more deep-processing strategies and a risingpersonal interest in the domain
"Toward mid-level competence, this investment inthe domain becomes a compelling force that is marked by individuals’ intentionalACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT 645"
"pursuit of knowledge and experiences related to the field, a transformational process we have documented in the words and actions of competent learners in such diversedomains as reading and history (Fox & Dinsmore, 2009; Maggioni et al., 2009)"
"For the relatively rare percentage of individuals who reach the stage of profi - ciency or expertise, their domain and topic knowledge is understandably exten - sive"
Even more indicative of their expertise is that these individuals are expected to be engaged in activities that contribute new knowledge and understandings tothe domain
"This transformational knowledge comes about, in part, because theseindividuals are truly engrossed in and self-identify with the domain"
"Further, theirinterest helps them strategically engage in problem finding and problem cre - ation—an engagement that is extensively deep-processing in character"
It is cru - cial to note that these attributes of proficiency or expertise cannot be realistically achieved within the confines of typical K–16 education
"Nonetheless, the foundations for exper - tise must be established during these formative years and should be reflected in the goals and experiences that compose K–16 education.646 ALEXANDER FIGURE 1 A representation of the changing relation of domain and topic knowledge, sur- face-level and deep-processing strategies, and individual and situational interest over the stagesof the model of domain learning."
"The evidence we have gathered from young students to renowned experts has provided support for the MDL in a range of domains, from biology, astrophysics,and history to reading, educational psychology, and special education (e.g., Alex - ander, Kulikowich, & Schulze, 1994)"
"Others researchers have found the MDL worthy of exploration as well and have put the predictions of the model to the testin such domains as physical education, social studies, engineering, technology,and music therapy (e.g., Chen, Shen, Scrabis, & Tolley, 2002; Lawless & Kuli - kowich, 1998; VanSledright, 2002)"
"What these data suggest is that academic de - velopment is a promising way to consider the long-term, continuous influence of cognitive and motivational factors on learners and learning"
"Yet there is muchmore to be done to test the MDL and to allow for fuller exploration of changes overtime within domains and disciplines, that is, to inform understanding of academicdevelopment"
"Clearly, longitudinal studies that reveal the orchestrated changes in these cogni - tive and noncognitive forces are necessary, along with studies that explore critical transition periods in the lives of learners at varying ages and in varying socioculturalcontexts"
"We are also concerned with how one first gets a solid foothold in a domain,as in the emergence of children’s individual interest (Jablonski & Alexander, 2009)or the manner in which intentionality drives development even in the face of strug-gles or setbacks (Kulikowich & Alexander, 2009)"
"We are also working diligently touncover more precise but less intrusive measures of strategic processing (Fox & Al-exander, 2009)"
"Although there is much work to be done and far more interdisciplin-ary inquiry to be initiated, we remain excited about the prospects of discoveringmore about the nature of human domain learning in the years to come"
"Again, this work on the MDL represents just one examination of academic de- velopment"
It is by no means the only or best approach to investigating academicdevelopment
"Thus, we look forward to many other investigations into the multi - tude of factors, situations, or contexts that can illuminate the nature of this intrigu - ing construct and guide us in fostering optimal development for all who walk through the doors of our schools in hopes of becoming well educated"
"As did thelate Robert Gagné (1977), we remain committed to helping students become morecompetent and more capable of adjusting to the complexities of life in a post - industrial society, not only so that they may survive but also so that they may “find a satisfying quality to their lives” (p"
MOVING BEYOND THE MYTHOLOGY What I have endeavored to show is that we can no longer allow the educational mythos to survive if we truly intend for formal schooling to set learners on a pathtoward optimal learning and development
