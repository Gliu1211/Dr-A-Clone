SENTENCES
"In our use of the term theoretical perspective, we are acknowl- edging that broad orientations to learning are instantiated by particular models and theories offering mechanisms of learning"
"Our focus is most often on how the broad cat-egories, or perspectives, fare in the criterial evaluation to which we put them"
The accomplishment of our overarching intention was predicated on the completion of four speciﬁc and interrelated tasks
"Therefore, we ﬁrst articulate principles of learning, ac- ceptable to those holding multiple theoretical perspectives,and basic to a viable conceptualization of learning"
"Second, we position four dimensions of learning within an interactive framework that can serve as a basis for judging the com-prehensiveness and potential viability of current and future theoretical perspectives and empirical investigations"
"Third, having considered these common principles and interactivedimensions, we forward a working deﬁnition of learning"
"Last, we present three exemplars to illustrate the way in which the interactive dimensions of learning dynamically unfold in everyday instances of human learning"
It is important to consider the value of this endeavor be- fore we initiate these tasks
One apparent value is to bring the notion of learning into the realm of explicit discourse so that we may contemplate the construct more deeply
"Although itwould be convenient if the nature of learning were well estab- lished thereby requiring no detailed explication, we contend that there is no such clear consensus and that a thoughtful,critical look at the very nature of learning is beneﬁcial, both for those just entering the ﬁeld and for those more deeply invested in the domain"
"In this article, we want to highlighthow conceptualizations of learning, whether expressed or not, shape everyday decisions that have import in our lives"
"In addition, it is easy to read the research literature as implying that each professed view on learning is fully ade- quate and thus requires no further justiﬁcation"
"Such views, we suggest, have underestimated the complexity of learningand led to a disregard for competing notions and to a frac- turing of the community along theoretical fault lines"
"Such parochialism and fracturing can contribute to a balkanization of the ﬁeld, an unproductive breakdown in willingness to en- tertain alternative frameworks beyond the level of caricature.This lack of theoretical comity within education and psychol- ogy as to the nature of learning has been noted (Alexander, 1997; Eisner, 1997; Mayer, 2001; Reynolds, Sinatra, & Jet-ton, 1996; Schallert & Martin, 2003)"
"Indeed, contrasting and contentious views of learning dot the educational landscape and hinder progress in this domain for researchers and practi-tioners alike"
"Nonetheless, because learning remains core to educational and psychological (e.g., cognitive, motivational, and emotional) endeavors despite its problematic and elusivenature, we consider it worthwhile to search for a way to frame the problem differently"
Our proposal is that the seemingly irreconcilable differ- ences among theoretical perspectives arise largely from theirspeciﬁc position in the learning landscape and the vista on learning that each position affords
This is not to say that all such perspectives are equally defensible
"Rather, we at- tempt to demonstrate that their differences may arise from de- fending quite different locales within the learning landscape.Such views as espoused by cognitive contextualists (Ander- son, 1977; Bransford, 1979; Piaget, 1926; Spiro, Vispoel, Schmitz, Samarapungavan, & Boerger, 1987), sociocultural-ists (Anderson et al., 2001; Schoultz,S ¨alj¨o, & Wyndhamn, 2001; Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch & Kanner, 1992), cognitive- evolutionist researchers (Donald, 1991; Geary, 2005; Pinker,2002; Plotkin, 1998), and situativists (Cobb, 1994; Cole & Engstr ¨om, 1993; Greeno & van de Sande, 2007), among others, give us an invaluable but limited view of learning’ slandscape"
"Speciﬁcally, our approach is to propose a topo- graphical framework for the learning system that allows us to pinpoint more accurately contemporary theories and modelson the basis of their attention to essential dimensions of learn- ing"
"Once positioned within this multidimensional space, we can then undertake a more thoughtful analysis of the theories and models not only in terms of their conceptualization of learning but also their ability to capture particular facets ofthe learning system in valid and reliable ways"
"FINDING COMMON GROUND When the three of us began our analysis, we were aware that through a long history of involvement in this domain, almost a century cumulatively, we had developed afﬁnities for theo-retical perspectives that perceive learning from diverse, and sometimes even seemingly incommensurate, vantage points"
"Despite good intentions to set aside personal agendas andtheoretical perspectives and to achieve a shared understand- ing, we found that differences in our conceptualizations of learning quickly asserted themselves and became barriers toprogress, even threatening to scuttle the enterprise"
"For that reason, we determined that any hope for success required that we ﬁrst seek common ground, a basis from which subsequentdelineations could emerge"
"In essence, we sought consilience, a term introduced by Whewell (1840) and used by Wilson (1998) to describe unity of knowledge across varied disci-plines"
We appropriated the term to refer to our efforts to ﬁnd commonality across varied perspectives on learning in the same ﬁeld
"Throughout, we focused expressly on human learning, acknowledging that aspects of the common ground we were seeking might well apply to other living organisms"
"A surprising by-product of this initial theoretical compact was that the common ground we sought took the form of principles and, more important, principles foundational tothe nature of human learning"
We appreciate that the sim- plicity of the language we use and the brevity of the points expressed may unintentionally mask the signiﬁcance of theprinciples we forward
It is conceivable that those long en- gaged in the study of learning may be tempted to dismiss
"178 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS this collection of principles as givens, or as commonsense or well-established axioms of learning"
"First, for all our years and investment in this domain, we are not aware of any explication of the nature of learning that captures all thepoints articulated herein"
"Further, what may seem common- sense to experts in learning and learning theory cannot be treated as such by those who are either new to the domainor whose expertise does not fall directly under the banner of learning"
"Finally, to those who would see our principles as self-evident, we point to the late Nate Gage’s (1991) seminalessay titled “The Obviousness of Social and Educational Re- search Results,” in which such impressions were frequently shown to be untrustworthy"
"With this caveat in place, we now turn to the resulting nine principles: rPrinciple 1 Learning is changerPrinciple 2 Learning is inevitable, essential, and ubiqui- tousrPrinciple 3 Learning can be resistedrPrinciple 4 Learning may be disadvantageousrPrinciple 5 Learning can be tacit and incidental as well as conscious and intentionalrPrinciple 6 Learning is framed by our humannessrPrinciple 7 Learning refers to both a process and a prod- uctrPrinciple 8 Learning is different at different points in timerPrinciple 9 Learning is interactional Principle 1: Learning Is Change A fundamental characteristic of what it means for humans to learn is that change happens"
"This notion of change ap- plies whether the focus is on simpler learning of physical movements (e.g., skipping on one foot) or more complexlearning of abstract principles (e.g., understanding the al- legorical nature of the American classic Moby-Dick)"
"For instance, change may be seen as the development of socialpractices in individuals or groups, or change may be regarded as altered conceptions that arise from person–environment interactions"
"Alternatively, change might be understood asarising from the evolved, innate processing capacities of the human brain/mind and the adaptive nature inherent in human beings or as being driven by stages of physiological matu- ration"
"Indeed, there are no current conceptions of learning that do not include the notion of change, either explicitly orimplicitly"
"First, the change that happens can range from the dramatic to the almost imperceptible"
"Second, change canoccur over inﬁnite scales of time; it can occur in an instant or transpire over expanses of time"
"In effect, just as a river sculpts aspects of thelandscape, even as aspects of the landscape shape the river, change that happens in the learner, be it dramatic or imper-ceptible, or immediate or gradual, exerts a reciprocal effect on the learner’s surroundings"
"Principle 2: Learning Is Inevitable, Essential, and Ubiquitous Being alive means being a learner"
"Being alive for humans brings with it the inevitability of learning, as well as its ne- cessity"
"In effect, one cannot prevent learning from occurring(inevitable), nor can one hope to survive unless learning hap- pens (essential)"
"Moreover, learning is not relegated to any singular physical or cultural environment, but unfolds wher-ever humans move in the world (ubiquitous)"
"Indeed, learning is a biological imperative for human beings; so much so that most of learning happens automatically and is not under theconscious control of the learner (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999; Norman, 1968; Reber, 1989)"
"In his commentary on human memory, Flavell (1971) asserted that children do not need tobe taught how to remember; memory happens"
"Humans are evolved learners, and through matu- ration and experience, certain aspects of learning becomeseemingly effortless and below the level of consciousness, whereas other aspects become more complex, differentiated, and demand conscious effort (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 1999)"
"Although educational researchers and practitioners regularly invest attention on forms of higher order learning,it is important to remember that learning also encompasses these less apparent, yet critical, forms of learning (Reynolds, 2000)"
"Although the learning of nonhuman animals has received much atten- tion from researchers, particularly in the ﬁrst half of the 20thcentury, it is not difﬁcult to gain consensus on the point that humans are fascinating examples of learning systems (es- pecially to other humans)"
What makes humans fascinatingas learners is that they enter the world in such a helpless state but possess innate abilities that avail them of the op- portunity to acquire understandings and procedures over arelatively short period
Such innate capacities coupled with environmental and contextual affordances permit humans to navigate even arduous social and physical terrains
"Learning is ubiquitous, applying in all sorts of situations and in all sorts of environments"
"Even though we are prone to conceive of learning as nested in schools and associate it with formal educational systems and procedures, learningwill not be so delimited"
The processes of learning are in operation whenever and wherever humans are situated
"Principle 3: Learning Can Be Resisted As inevitable, essential, and ubiquitous as learning is, a curi- ous corollary is that there are instances when humans resistlearning (and the change it implies), even ﬁnding it painful"
LEARNING TOPOGRAPHY 179 there are many times when we learn in spite of ourselves
Why are we sometimes so reluctant to engage in the effort required to learn a new way of thinking or acting even when the goal is desirable
"It could well be that the effort required is judged as too great, or the rewardstoo small (Kahneman, 1973; Wigﬁeld & Eccles, 2000), or the likelihood of success deemed too risky for learning to be pursued"
Or it is possible that the attainment of the desiredgoal might create dissonance within the individual or par- ticular social system that cannot be tolerated
"Thus, it often happens that opportunities for changing deeply held or ha-bitual ways of interacting with the world are sometimes, at least initially, circumvented, resisted, or denied"
"Conceived in this manner, this principle of learning embraces much of thetheoretical and empirical work within the literatures on con- ceptual change (e.g.,V osniadou, 2003) and epistemic beliefs (e.g., Murphy & Mason, 2006)"
"Principle 4: Learning May Be Disadvantageous It seems clear that learning results in changes that are not always advantageous to self or others.Y et, because the con- struct of learning has such positive connotations, it may be important to make this principle explicit"
"We cannot limit learning only to what is valued, accepted, or acceptable"
Here we must clarify that the notion of advantageous or disadvantageous that we posit has two valid interpreta- tions
"On one hand, there is the learning that happens whensomeone has learned something that he or she wishes had never been learned (e.g., smoking or howp ˆat´ed efo i egr as is made)"
"On the other hand, there is the learning that is utile and satisfying to the person (and perhaps a group of like- minded individuals), but disadvantageous and undesirable tosome broader social group (e.g., excessive online gaming)"
"Although the more positive and advantageous outcomes of learning are what may be sought, the learning system doesnot discriminate"
"Principle 5: Learning Can Be Tacit and Incidental as Well as Conscious and Intentional Much (perhaps most) learning happens outside the realm of conscious control or intentionality (Epstein, 2001; Polanyi,1966); hence, much of learning is tacit and incidental"
"Often learners cannot give an explicit rendering of when learningoccurred, how learning happened, or how they were changed"
"Even in the classroom where academic development is the business at hand, much of learning lives in the water table be- low the surface"
What proportion of learning is tacit remains open to debate; Bargh and Chartrand (1999) suggested thatas much as 90% of all learning is implicit
"Whatever the pro- portion is, we would agree that, just as in the physical world, there is much below the surface of learning’s landscape"
"For example, a student learning the concept of solving for an unknown in an algebraic equation is learning mathemat- ical ideas, and we would say this is the student’s intentionaltask"
"However, at the same time, the student is learning the language of algebra with its peculiar vocabulary, symbolic representations, and syntactic constructions, as well as thesocial practices that this algebra classroom prefers, such as how solutions should look on paper or how homework pages should be stapled"
"Turning to out-of-school examples, wewant to point to the largely unconscious and incidental na- ture of ﬁrst language acquisition and of motor development, where in both domains the interaction of environment and in- nate human wiring results in particularly suitable outcomes (Chomsky, 1957; Clark, 1994; Wells, 1987)"
"Moreover, evenwhen acquisition was initially effortful and conscious, subse- quent use of that learning can be unconscious and automatic"
Language is again a great example as when individuals auto-matically deploy what they know about words and the syntax of their language even as their conscious focus is on how to express what they want to say
Principle 6: Learning Is Framed by Our Humanness Our humanness plays a critical role in how we learn and what we learn
Here we are primarily referring to the contri- bution of the particular neurobiological architecture humans have developed
"Spock, we are “carbon-based” life-forms whose neurological structures shape the nature of how the world is experienced and whose senses are conduits for interacting with the world and withothers who populate that world"
Those senses are particu- lar in structure for our species and limited in range
Their evolved structure and the environment that has surroundedthem across time restrict our senses and cognitive processes
"Consequently, the colors we see, the tones we hear, the smells we can detect, and the nature of our reasoning are all con- strained by our evolved biology"
It is not just that our neurological and biological bases frame the processes and products of learning
"Even within the range of human possibilities, there is variability with which we must contend"
"Just as some of us are taller orfaster than others, some of us have greater visual acuity, or memory capacity, or facility with language than others"
"Indeed, there can be signiﬁcant differences among individ-uals with regard to any cognitive or noncognitive factor"
"180 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS boundaries within which learning may be constrained in the human system"
"Thus, just as our evolved biology—that which makes us human—must be embraced in any model or theory of learning, so too must the differences that manifest at the level of the individual be recognized"
"Principle 7: Learning Refers to Both a Process and a Product Descriptions of learning frequently toggle between portray- ing learning as a process, as a set of operations progressing through time, and depicting it as an end-product of that pro-cess, much like a chemical substance is produced when ele- ments are combined"
"When we think of learning as a process, we are focusing on the time course of operations resultingin relatively durable changes"
"When we consider learning as product, we are referring to the relatively durable change that results when learning has occurred, as when new ideas orprocedures have been internalized or memories accumulated as a result of experiences in the physical world or in the world of the mind"
"Where learning as process refers to the change as it is taking place, learning as product refers to the outcome of that process"
Formal measures of learning are almost always about learning as product—the consequences of learning
"Although it is perhaps unfortunate that the same word refersto a progressive action and a gerundial noun and may lead to misinterpretations that pivot exactly on this difference, it is our contention that any comprehensive rendering of learn-ing must regard this construct as both process and product"
"Indeed, research in which the focus is only on learning as a product may oversimplify our conception of the learningprocess"
The same applies to research in which process is all that is considered
"Principle 8: Learning Is Different at Different Points in Time Because learning is a process, change transpires in time and over time, and leads one to focus on the dynamic ﬂux of factors affecting the beginning, middle, and late stages of learning"
The learning process itself is affected by where thelearner is in a progression to increasing expertise and acqui- sition of knowledge in a domain
"This developmental view of learning is tied in part to the neurological and biological changes that come with age (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002)"
"We learn differently at different ages, and the process oflearning changes, reﬂecting the accumulation of experiences that give rise to more complex understandings and more intri- cate relationships among individuals or the relations betweenperson and environment (Bereiter, 2002; Wentzel, 1999)"
"As mature individuals, we cannot draw aside the veil of life ex- periences to see the world as we did in our childhood"
"Wemay seek to “remember” what we thought or felt, but those memories are never replications or duplications.This phenomenon occurs in part because of the recursive and iterative nature of learning; processes result in prod- ucts that in turn inﬂuence subsequent processes"
"An often- cited example can be found in the Matthew effect (Stanovich, 1986), which, simply stated, refers to when a learning prod-uct (e.g., graphophonemic knowledge that underlies rapid and accurate word recognition) interacts with the process of learning (e.g., comprehending), what Stanovich called a re- ciprocal causation effect"
"Those with decoding facility read more and hence acquire more background knowledge, which in turn leads to better understanding of future informationand more reading, and so on"
"Principle 9: Learning Is Interactional When we assert that learning is interactional, we are high- lighting that learning engages an intermutual sequence of op- erations that are shaped by human culture and biology, amonga host of such inﬂuences, and by how humans act and react to a dynamically changing world"
"All serious discussions of learning would agree that the world “out there” matters tohow learning takes place, although there might be debate in how to construe that world (Bereiter, 1994; Stanovich, 2000)"
"Moreover, any postbehaviorist learning perspective includes in its description of the interactive nature of learning, the iter- ative coinﬂuences between current and past constructions orrepresentations"
"In this interactional mix, continual change occurs not only to learners, but to the context in which learn- ing is embedded as well"
"Learners are inﬂuenced by, and atthe same time push back, take from, change, control, and create the environment in which learning is situated"
FRAMING THE NATURE OF LEARNING Embedded in the nine principles of learning are characteris- tics that stand as salient attributes of this complex but elu- sive construct
"The careful deﬁnition of core constructs is certainly a necessary step in any effort to formulate theory,build models, or conduct investigations; yet more is required"
"In theory and research, conceptualization and operationaliza- tion must go hand and hand"
"Thus, although the principlesof learning help us answer the question “What is learning,” they cannot help us answer the question of whether an ex- isting perspective of learning is fully speciﬁed or of whether a particular attempt to engineer learning represents a viable operationalization of the construct"
"What is also requiredare criteria that will allow us to judge the manner in which core constructs are theorized, modeled, or empirically inves- tigated"
"Toward that end, we offer the dimensions of learningas components in an interactive framework"
"Speciﬁcally, we assert that any comprehensive theoretical perspective of learning should be constituted of at least fourdimensions that are continuously interwoven and interactive, represented by the what,where,who, and when of learning."
"LEARNING TOPOGRAPHY 181 As we seek to demonstrate, although there may well be other features to the learning system that merit consideration in a speciﬁc instantiation of learning, these four dimensions should be viewed as primary (i.e., necessary)"
"Although we describe each dimension separately, the interactional per-spective represented by Principle 9 holds that learning in- volves the continual interplay of multiple dimensions at any point or under any circumstance"
"Indeed, we describe ourrendering of this emergent framework for learning as topo- graphical precisely because we think the interplay among these four dimensions results in a shape to learning that isﬂuid and dynamic, but that also gives rise to discernible and predictable patterns that are multiply determined"
"We acknowledge that current contrasting views of learn- ing attend to one or more of these dimensions, however tac- itly.Y et it is also our contention that no existing perspective of which we are aware has explicitly addressed all four ofthese dimensions in any systemic manner"
"Rather, what we have determined is that current theoretical orientations cen- ter on certain dimensions, such as the who and what or the who and where dimensions, without due consideration for other equally important facets"
"Certainly, extant theoreticalperspectives on learning have not dealt with the time di- mension, the when, in the innovative way that we do"
We support this contention by demonstrating how seemingly op-positional views can be subsumed within our broader four- dimensional framework largely because they are seeking to explain learning from different vantage points within thismultidimensional space
"Moreover, because much of the emphases within existing theoretical perspectives resides at the juncture of person–environment (i.e., the who–where connection), we have cho- sen to begin discussion with the what of learning and con- clude with the when of learning, dimensions of seemingly less import in extant accounts"
"In our presentation of the interactive framework, we consider how distinctions among orientations that might be seen as incommensurate outsidethe purview of our topographical framework can more accu- rately be depicted as differential positions within the vector space created by the what,where,who, and when dimensions"
"Dimension 1: The What of Learning A comprehensive rendering of learning must give due consid- eration to the objects or foci of that dynamic system (Gius- sani, 1995)"
There is always a what that is being learned or that is in the process of change
"Further, there is am- ple evidence that the objects of learning are distinguishable and classiﬁable, and that those differences are signiﬁcantin how the process of learning unfolds"
"For our purposes, we propose that the whats of learning can be well repre- sented as different levels ranging from acquired habits andconditioned responses, to spontaneous concepts and action sequences learned in everyday informal interactions with the FIGURE 1 A representation of interactive complexiﬁcation as per- taining to the what of learning"
"world, to scientiﬁc concepts and practices that are often the result of formal education, as illustrated in Figure 1"
These levels are formed from the interplay of various fac- tors implicated in the learning process
"Those factors, which can systemically vary in degree (e.g., intensity, frequency, ormagnitude), include but are not limited to the degree to which enculturation into a particular social practice is required, or the degree to which conscious effort is needed, or the degreeof abstraction or complexity involved"
What distinguishes the levels of learning to which we refer is the extent to which their attainment depends on a particular interplay of thesesalient factors
"Because we feared that using an existing term from the ﬁeld might carry with it inappropriate connotations, we coined the term interactive complexiﬁcation to refer to the conﬂuence of factors that give rise to the increasing intricacy of any given aspect of the products or processes (i.e., the whats) of learning"
"We appreciate that there may be other systems of clas- sifying the what of learning that rely on other features or mechanisms than our own interactive complexiﬁcation; wit- ness Spiro’s (with Feltovich, Jacobson, & Coulson, 1992) insightful identiﬁcation of important differences betweenwell-structured and ill-structured domains"
"We do not view these alternatives as problematic, provided that they are jus- tiﬁed and defensible"
"Rather, our critical point here is thattheoretical perspectives must take account of the differing objects of learning in some manner and not treat learning as a unitary process or outcome"
"For instance, it is not our goalto support or refute behaviorism as a theory of learning but rather to argue that certain premises underlying a behavior"
"182 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS theory perspective are easier to understand and apply if one stays within the realm of acquired habits"
"When behaviorism meanders away from this familiar terrain, it is far less sustain- able, as the history of psychology has so clearly demonstrated (Robins, Gosling, & Craik, 1999)"
"Of course, the same ar-gument can be directed toward any other theory of learning"
Our contention is that certain conﬂicts between stances on learning rest on their disregard of this very concern
"Given this understanding and prior to describing attributes and characteristics of the ﬁrst level, acquired habits and con- ditionings, we want to acknowledge that all learning has as itsfoundation a biological and neurological basis (as represented by the base of the helix in Figure 1)"
"Inborn reﬂexes, abilities, and capacities are initiating points for future physical, cog-nitive, and psychosocial development"
"Whereas such inborn reﬂexes, abilities, and capacities are not themselves learned, they represent the primordial matter from which learningemerges over time and space and, in fact, remain inﬂuential across the levels"
This continuing inﬂuence is depicted as the axis of the helix in Figure 1
"Consider, for example, what might qualify as inborn re- ﬂexes, abilities, and capacities for the domain of reading—adomain with which we are intimately familiar"
"For one, we might regard certain perceptual and visual processes, such as the ability to discriminate light and dark areas or to dis-cern objects in the visual ﬁeld (Gibson, 1966), as among the hard-wired abilities that support children’s later literacy de- velopment"
"The ability to see light and dark or shapes comeswith the human system and is, clearly, not reading in itself"
"Similarly, the human capacity to ﬁnd commonalities acrossexperiences, to form categories out of what is perceived, and to make cause and effect judgments supports and interacts with learning at all levels of interactive complexiﬁcation"
"The ﬁrst level of the “what” dimension comprises ac- quired habits and conditionings representing simpler learned responses to the world that are often more concrete, are lesssocialized, and may require conscious awareness for a shorter period than other levels"
"Returning to our literacy example, within a matter of months, most infants gain the ability to hear and pronounce a range of phonemes representative of the lan- guage around them, even as they learn to hold a book, graspthe corner of a page, and turn to the next"
These acquired habits and conditionings will continue to support reading even as it progresses across levels
"At the next level of the what model are the spontaneous concepts that humans acquire from the extraordinary num- ber of different learning opportunities they encounter, infor-mally or incidentally, over the course of a lifetime—from dressing one’s self to engaging in appropriate conversation, from cooking a meal to learning how to parent"
"Such sponta-neous concepts, with their associated actions and emotions, can acquire the status of scientiﬁc concepts and practices, the next level, as when one realizes a love for and interestin cooking and takes up the preparation of becoming a chefor a food science expert"
"The role of spontaneous concepts and actions is very evident in early literacy development, as when children begin to acquire print concepts and read- ing conventions through interactions with those that populate their environment or as a consequence of focused effort"
"When it comes to the third level of the what dimension, our choice of the term scientiﬁc concept follows usage in- troduced by Vygotsky (1934/1986) not to represent conceptsabout science as a discipline (or not only about science) but to refer to “languaged” ideas that have become abstracted or generalized from human interactions and aligned with formaldisciplines or communities of practice"
"Thus, scientiﬁc con- cepts are often associated with intentional learning or formal knowledge (Gardner, 1991), in contrast to spontaneous con-cepts that are, in effect, less formalized understandings often acquired from everyday experiences (Vygotsky, 1934/1986) and often associated with unintended or incidental learning(Reber, 1989; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1984)"
"Thus, as one ex- amines the interactive complexiﬁcation of the “what” dimen- sion, there is an increased need for the support and guidance of others to assist in one’s learning (Anderson et al., 2001; Cobb, Wood, &Y ackel, 1991)"
We represent this aspect bythe enculturation strand of the helix in Figure 1
"In addition, as the learning progresses across levels, there is the real possibility that a successful outcome will neces-sitate greater effort exerted across time and place (the effort strand)"
"Because reading development continues across the lifespan, there are many scientiﬁc concepts and practices thatcome as individuals engage in increasingly demanding, spe- cialized, and potentially more abstract print-related activities"
"For instance, scientiﬁc concepts and practices come into playas individuals encounter technical or domain-speciﬁc texts or are introduced to new genres or new ways of analyzing a variety of traditional and nontraditional texts"
"Overall, Figure 1 represents our attempt to portray how certain factors implicated in learning operate at varying de- grees and how their changing nature individually and in con-cert (what we call interactive complexiﬁcation) with other signiﬁcant factors constitute distinguishable levels of learn- ing’s objects or foci"
"As we suggested, we contend that these levels and the interplay of factors they represent encom- pass the foci of a range of learning perspectives that mightotherwise appear at odds"
"For instance, the whats that gar- ner much attention from behavior theorists would ﬁt well within the acquired habits and conditionings level of our de-piction, whereas the interests of sociocultural theorists may more often nest themselves at the level of scientiﬁc con- cepts and practices"
"What developmental theorists might em-phasize in their research, by comparison, is not the whats that fall at any one level of our representation, but rather the process by which individuals progress within and acrossthose levels"
"Cognitive-evolutionary theorists, like develop- mental theorists, might be drawn to movement across levels, especially as it pertains to the ever-present inﬂuence of hu-mans’ inborn reﬂexes, abilities, and capacities on the nature"
"LEARNING TOPOGRAPHY 183 FIGURE 2 A model of the interactive nature of the what, where, and who dimensions of learning at time and across time (i.e., thewhen dimension)"
"Further, just as these individual strands contin- ually interact with each other to give the what dimension its character, so too does the what dimension interact with thewhere,who, and when dimensions to give learning its character, as we will see shortly (see Figure 2)"
Dimension 2: The Where of Learning Learning does not happen in a vacuum
The where of learn- ing refers to the ecological context in which learning occurs
"By ecological context, we are referring to such primary as- pects as the physical environment and the social and culturalmilieu that are intertwined and interdependent in their inﬂu- ence on learning"
"An interesting characteristic of this ecology is that there is an intermingling of the more concrete withthe more abstract, and of the more physical with the more social, inﬂuencing the learning process at every turn"
"As ina river system, there are physical elements and tangibles in the learning ecology that shape the ﬂow of learning"
"As well, there are social and cultural inﬂuences that emerge from the cultural practices and social dynamics in which the learning is taking place, especially as learning progresses toward thelevel of scientiﬁc concepts and practices"
"Consider, for example, a 1-year-old who has discovered the wonders of banging a spoon on a highchair tray"
"At thispoint, banging requires a coordination of movement that may have begun accidentally but quickly developed into a rhyth- mic movement with its attendant cacophony of sounds"
Thephysical context impinging on learning may involve the pro- cessing of the distance between hand and tray and of how the spoon ﬁts in the child’s hand for maximum effect
"Atthis point, the social/cultural context may include how adults in the family interpret, react to, and label the child’s bang- ing and the particular kind of highchair and spoon that havecome to be used in that home"
"As the child grows older, the context surrounding drumming may develop to include what it means to learn to play the drums musically, with all its related cultural practices"
"Reading musical notation, knowing when to quiet a drumhead, and responding to a con-ductor’s subtle direction become contextual features to which the budding percussionist must appropriately respond, even as our learner reacts conceptually, motivationally, and emo-tionally to the degree to which this new skill is appreciated by the local culture"
"Moreover, as learning proceeds, what the learner takes the context to be changes"
This ever-changinginterpretation of what exactly is salient and relevant about the contextual ecology inﬂuences the process and products of learning
One of many domains in which contextual inﬂuences have been studied is reading
"It sometimes pertains to thetexts themselves, including their organization, structure, and features (Chambliss & Calfee, 1998; Meyer & Poon, 2001; Schallert, 1976)"
"Context can also refer to the physical placein which the reading occurs, such as in the home (Purcell- Gates, 2007), in the classroom (e.g., reading class or other content domains; Jetton & Alexander, 2004), or in out-of- school environments (e.g., libraries, museums, or everyday locales; Moje & O’Brien, 2001)"
"Or it can relate to the modeor medium of delivery, (e.g., online or hypermedia environ- ments; Leu et al., 2007)"
"Also, the where of reading can focus on the human resources that are present and that may serveto facilitate or inhibit the learning process or its outcomes (Allington, 2001; Almasi, 1995)"
"Finally, as with the other learning dimensions, the where of learning interacts with the what, who, and when (see Figure 2)"
"To explore just one of these interactions, we want to highlight how a learner’s relation with context changes overtime"
"When one is learning something new, the particular physical environment and social/cultural setting are critical to how the learning proceeds"
"In fact, these details of contextare so critical that often one’s initial steps in learning will"
"184 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS incorporate them as essential components of the learning, leading to learning that seems tied to the situation"
"Theorists of a certain persuasion might claim that all learning is like this, situated in particular contexts of practice (Greeno & van de Sande, 2007)"
"However, exactly because contexts arethemselves always changing, the learner must continue to ad- just, adapt, and broaden the application of what was learned and to respond appropriately to contextual cues in the hereand now that are close enough but slightly different from the context that was in place when learning “began.” Dimension 3: The Who of Learning With the who dimension, we are pointing to how learning is inﬂuenced by characteristics of the learner along biological, cognitive, experiential (including individual and cultural ex-perience), and affective (motivation/emotion) lines"
"Further, we acknowledge that the particulars of all that a learner brings to a situation critically inﬂuence the process and product oflearning"
"Indeed, over time humans have evolved a number of innate learning capacities that have helped them become more efﬁcient and effective learners, thus enabling them tosurvive and prosper in their ecological niche"
"For example, humans appear to have a capacity to distinguish between a temporal string of nonrelated stimuli and a similarly appear-ing string that displays a series of cause and effect relations (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002; Kant, 1787/1963)"
"As we begin to explicate this dimension, we are aware that a frequent interpretation of learner characteristics aligns itself with measuring individual differences in achievementor performance on high-stakes exams"
"Because our focus is on learning, we want to make explicit the distinction be- tween learning and achievement, concepts that we think havebeen conﬂated in the educational and psychological litera- tures (Alexander & Riconscente, 2005)"
"Because achieve- ment test scores measure performance and not learning perse, they include measures of factors not representative of learning either as process or product"
The kinds of learner characteristics that we consider im- portant are several
"We acknowledge that simply by virtue of evolved biology and how humans are wired, who the learner is plays acritical role in the learning process"
"The embodied conscious- ness that represents the human learner cannot help but shape the learning process (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999)"
"For example, although it is highly unlikely to ﬁnd a personwith more than three times the normal working memory ca- pacity, there is always variation in working memory across humans, as well as in the capacities of the brain to processinformation efﬁciently"
These differences can be detected in both the processes and products of learning
"Readers’ ﬂuency is associ- ated in part with the graphophonemic abilities they bring tothe text, combined with their working memory capacity and their skill at producing the desired sounds and expressions apace"
"Another source of inﬂuence on learning is represented by learners’ motives, intentions, and general psychologicaltraits"
What are learners in a particular learning situation consciously or unconsciously seeking to accomplish
Much attention has been paid to motivational and emotional differences among learners
"As this litera- ture reminds us, individuals not only manifest different goalsfor learning, but also ascribe different values to learning, have varied expectations for success (Linnenbrink & Pin- trich, 2003; Pintrich & Schrauben, 1992; Wigﬁeld & Eccles,2000), and experience different emotions during the pro- cess (Damasio, 2005; Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002)"
"Different psychological traits (e.g., persistence or extrover-sion) inﬂuence the learning of individuals even when they ﬁnd themselves more or less in the same physical context confronting the same cognitive task (Matthews, Zeidner, & Roberts, 2006)"
"The motives, intentions, emotional states, and interests of readers have garnered increasing attention in the last decade (Guthrie & Cox, 2001; Wigﬁeld & Guthrie, 1997)"
This grow- ing presence has illustrated that those who perform well ata given reading task or who manifest a positive learning trajectory in the domain have more than the neurophysio- logical basics
"They also have a reported interest in read-ing generally or in the particular domain or topic of the text (Wade, 2001)"
"They are more likely to report an orien- tation toward learning about the domain/topic than towardsimply doing adequately on the task (Hidi & Harackiewicz, 2000)"
"They are also more apt to hold beliefs about them- selves as readers and about reading that will sustain themand promote their cognitive and affective engagement (Dai & Wanga, 2007)"
"Another example of learner characteristics that come into play in descriptions of learning is individuals’ previous learn- ing, the relevant knowledge they have acquired that they bring to bear in a particular learning situation (Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, & Goetz, 1977)"
We point to the extremely proliﬁc research on how prior knowledge inﬂuences learning
Theparticular interface between what one knows and what one is learning intimately inﬂuences what is understood from the interaction and what one takes away from it
"In an interesting study that combined two of these ways of differentiating learners, Walker (1987) compared army en- listed personnel who were either high or low in aptitude tolearn (based on scores on a standardized ability measure) and high or low in knowledge of baseball (based on responses to factual questions about the game) on how well they remem-bered an oral play-by-play of a half inning of a ﬁctitious baseball game"
Results indicated that participants with high baseball knowledge did better than those with low baseballknowledge whether they came from the high- or low-ability
"In fact, within the high-knowledge groups, low- ability recruits recalled as much of the play-by-play account as high-ability learners, and the low-ability/high-knowledge group outperformed the high-ability/low-knowledge group"
Walker’s study is interesting in the context of our con- sideration of the importance of learner characteristics be- cause it juxtaposed two different ways of thinking of how learners can differ from one another
"There are many otherstudies, some to which we have been intimately connected, that have demonstrated the clear impact that prior knowledge can have on learning something new (Alexander & Murphy,1998; Anderson et al., 1977; Goetz, Schallert, Reynolds, & Radin, 1983; Reynolds, Taylor, Steffensen, Shirey, & Ander- son, 1982)"
"In a review of the theoretical and empirical liter-ature on knowledge, Alexander, Schallert, and Hare (1991) offered a synthesis of the myriad of constructs associated with prior knowledge and showed how these interacted witheach other"
We close our discussion of this dimension with a point we have made in our descriptions of the what andwhere dimen- sions
"As we depict in Figure 2, the who dimension interacts with all other dimensions so that particular characteristicsof the learner are emphasized or deemphasized through in- teraction with what is being learned, in what context, and at different points in time"
"In effect, because people as learnersdiffer greatly, different facets of the who are instantiated or become more salient as the particulars of the what andwhen of learning unfold in time and space"
"Dimension 4: The When of Learning Others have recognized, in their way, the what,who, and where dimensions of human learning (Jenkins, 1974)"
"How- ever, the fourth dimension in our topography has received less consideration especially in interaction with the afore- mentioned learning dimensions.Y et just as learning does notoccur in a vacuum, there is always a temporal nature to learn- ing"
"As humans, our movements in the world are inevitably constrained both by time and space"
"With each impercepti-ble moment, the frame for learning has shifted, not merely because the place itself has changed (e.g., light refractions or creature movements), but because the learner himself orherself has changed, however inconspicuously, from Time 1 to Time 2"
It is precisely because of the invasiveness of time throughout this topography that we conceive of it as a force that must be addressed
"We ﬁnd that different renderings have in their purview, though rarely explicitly, many iterations and variations on the dimension of time, each representing different gradations inthe span of time considered or the distributions of events or the number of relevant experiences within a given interval of time"
"Consider the time frames of evolutionary theories vis- `a-vis sociocultural, cognitive-contextual, developmental, and situated perspectives on learning"
"For evolutionary theorists,the course of time that is of importance can be millennia or eras, as their primary concern is the mental adaptation and the consequent development of the human species as a result of mutation and natural selection"
"Thus, one might study aspects of learning that are biologically primary (numeracy)or secondary (reading) or the role of evolved adaptation in human development (Ellis & Bjorklund, 2005; Geary, 2005; Pinker, 2002; Reynolds & Sinatra, 2005)"
"From sociocultural perspectives, time is framed by the his- tory of a particular group, which could encompass months, years, or even centuries"
"Thus, one might study the cookie-selling practices of Girl Scouts (Rogoff, 1990), the ways in which graduate students come to adopt the proper stances, idiom, and understandings of a discipline (Fox, 1994), or themeaning and import of literacy to individuals born at different points in the 20th century (Brandt, 2001)"
"The time perspec- tive of developmental psychologists, by comparison, is thehuman life span and the predictable neurobiological, motor, cognitive, socioemotional changes that come with matura- tion and experience"
"The characteristics of young children as learners may be compared to those of older children, ado- lescents, or adults"
"By comparison, theoretical perspectivesconcerned with learning in situ appear more concentrated on the immediate temporal unfolding and on how words, ac- tions, or cultural artifacts are plied by individuals or groupsaround shared problems or tasks"
Time plays another role in certain orientations when learning is attributed to the fre- quency with which individuals encounter certain conditionsor are embedded in particular experiences
"Here, it is not time itself that matters but the ﬂow of experiences or the avail- ability of human and nonhuman resources that come with theﬂow of time"
"The intersection of these time orientations with the what, who, and where dimensions of learning can be well illus- trated in the study of expertise development within complex domains (Alexander, 2003; Spiro et al., 1992)"
"For one, the ability of individuals to move out of a state of acclimation ornaivet ´e in any ﬁeld is predicated in part on their level of neu- rological and biological development; that is, the mind and body must be at some sufﬁcient level of maturation or expe- rience to beneﬁt from any potentially educative event"
"Also, there are characteristics of the learner (the who) that becomerelevant in such development in that individuals may be more or less predisposed to the neurobiological, physical, cogni- tive, social, and motivational demands associated with anyparticular domain"
That is why individuals can be positioned at signiﬁcantly different points in expertise development for each and every complex domain
"The same person may wellbe acclimated in physics, competent in statistics, but expert in linguistics"
"Moreover, the human and nonhuman resources that in- dividuals will require will shift as they gain facility in the domain and as central principles of the domain become part of their knowledge core"
"Of course, it is also assumed that thejourney toward expertise means that the objects of learning"
"186 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS become increasingly more complex and that the processes and products of learning mirror that growing complexity"
"Also, it is well documented that the attainment of expertise in any complex domain requires an extended period, many thousands of relevant exposures, and the tapping into theknowledge of others (either with or without their explicit support and guidance) who have likewise attained expertise in that domain (Ericsson & Smith, 1991)"
"LEARNING DEFINED Now with the principles and dimensions of learning in place, we are ready to propose a deﬁnition of learning that operatesin concert with those principles and dimensions"
"Learning is a multidimensional process that results in a rel- atively enduring change in a person or persons, and conse- quently how that person or persons will perceive the world and reciprocally respond to its affordances physically, psy-chologically, and socially"
"The process of learning has as its foundation the systemic, dynamic, and interactive relation between the nature of the learner and the object of the learn-ing as ecologically situated in a given time and place as well as over time"
"Within formal logic, it is considered essential not just to establish what a thing is, but also to note what it is not (i.e.,antinomy)"
"Similarly, we think that our deﬁnition of learn- ing would be inadequate if we were unable to specify some aspects of what learning is not"
The principles that we pre- viously proffered serve us in this endeavor because certain characteristics of “not learning” are implicitly or explicitlystated within those principles
"First, all innate capacities, those genetically and biologically programmed inborn as- pects of our humanness, inﬂuence learning but are in andof themselves outside the parameters of learning as we have conceptualized it"
"Second, and related to the issue of innate- ness, the biological/neurological maturation of the humanorganism in and of itself does not constitute learning"
"Third, the simple recall of that which was previously learned does not constitute learning per se; only when recall results insome new conﬁguration or change does it reach the level of learning"
"Finally, although as sensory beings, humans are in continual physical contact with the world around them,only when those experiences leave some relatively enduring footprint do they fall within the realm of learning as we have deﬁned it"
TOUCHSTONE CASES It is easy when dealing with fundamental constructs that describe human functioning to remain at an abstract level that does not allow for a valid test of notions against thecomplexities that a real learning situation would bring with it
Learning is often so associated with formal instructional settings that it is easy to forget how ubiquitous it is
"Testing our developing notions about learning against different kinds of real-world situations challenges us to see whether ourviews are broad, comprehensive, and justiﬁable"
"The three examples we chose involve different kinds of learners, each learning something at different levels and in different placesand times"
"For each case, we attempt to establish why it represents learning and how it sits at the nexus of the primary dimensions within our topographical framework"
"Case 1: Biting Into a Cherry When Diane’s son, Robbie, was barely 2 years old, he had acquired some degree of experience with eating an array of“adult” foods"
"One might even say that he was skilled at bringing a spoon up to his mouth and swallowing yogurt or cereal he had scooped onto it from a bowl.Y et it oftenhappened that he would face some new substance and would have to learn about it, not only whether it was edible but also such characteristics as how it looked, how one should hold itto eat it, what to do with it in the mouth, and how it tasted"
"On a particular day, Robbie grabbed a cherry as his mother looked on, popped it into his mouth, and bit down"
Whatmade this otherwise insigniﬁcant step in Robbie’s knowledge acquisition of “cherry-as-foodstuff” memorable was the look of sharp surprise he displayed as his teeth met the pit of the cherry straight on
"It was clear that he had not “predicted” a cherry pit and that he did not, in some essential way, knowhow to eat a cherry"
"Where an adult carefully, albeit often automatically, negotiates the teeth around the center of the cherry and squeezes down making sure that the juice of thefruit stays inside the lips, Robbie had bit hard into the center of the cherry and had made bright red juice spurt out down the front of his T-shirt"
"Even by his second cherry, he wasmore cautious in biting, more careful about the mess of the juice, and more eager to reproduce the taste of the fruit"
"He had learned how to eat cherries, or more accurately, how notto eat them, adjusting his teeth and lips so as to avoid painful effects"
"According to our learning framework, Robbie was devel- oping a simple set of acquired actions (habits) and responding to the effect of the punishing stimulation coming from the pain of biting into a hard substance and of spoiling his fa- vorite T-shirt with red cherry juice"
What he had to learn in this situation—how to chew and how to position his mouthwith this new food—could not easily be acquired by imitation as most of what needed to be discovered was hidden from view.Y et his own physical sensations could “teach” him whatto do in this case
"Because Robbie was learning in a particular context, rep- resented by the physical environment (e.g., the objects on thepicnic table on the family patio, the presence of his mom and dad, the smells and tastes of the food, or the pain of having"
"LEARNING TOPOGRAPHY 187 bit into it wrong) and the social/cultural context (e.g., that his family loved cherries, that they saw them as a treat, or that they ate them directly out of a bowl) inﬂuenced whether he would want to have a cherry again, let alone know how to eat it"
"His learning was shaped by who he was as a learner ofcherry eating, his motives and likes, his ability to ﬁgure out how to position body parts so as to avoid pain and gain tasty sensations, his current level of maturation and knowledgedevelopment about this small domain, his favored status in his indulgent parents’ eyes, and a host of other characteris- tics that made him learn as he did on that particular occasion.Finally, because of his age and the number of times he had previously eaten a cherry, a trajectory to his learning could be envisioned even then"
"Now at the age of 30, Robbie caneat cherries with the best of them"
"The acquired habit and conditioned response this child had learned would be immediately understood by a learningtheorist coming from a behaviorist perspective, although the details of context, personal motives, and interpretations of the experience would likely be seen as unnecessary and distract- ing"
"Such a view might even downplay the importance of the maturational level of the learner even as it placed emphasison the feedback loop created by the pain sensations (and in less restrictive versions of the theory, the frustration of hav- ing spoiled a favorite shirt) on the acquisition of the properbehavioral production routines"
"By contrast, a sociocultural view might emphasize the meaning of a family picnic as a context to a child being introduced to a new food while over-looking, perhaps, the working out of the proper lip, teeth, and tongue movements required in eating a cherry properly"
"A cognitive-constructivist, on the other hand, might employthis case to illustrate the manner in which Robbie’s lack of experience and his still emerging schema for fruit-eating led to the undesired event and how this particular experiencewould likely add salient information to his mental model for cherry consumption"
"Case 2: Crossing the Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome In the second case, we describe what happened when Ralph, on a ﬁrst visit to Rome, had the occasion to cross one of themajor streets in Rome"
"Taking off on foot from his hotel, he had already spent several hours navigating the ruins of the old Forum when he decided to visit the Piazza Campo de Fiori designed by Michelangelo"
"Nothing particularly remarkable happened as he crossed several smaller streets on his waybut then he came to an extremely large street, Via dei Fori Imperiali, six lanes wide with vehicles crowding every lane and moving at a daunting rate of speed"
"Although critical elements of Ralph’s well-learned, Amer- ican street-crossing schema did not seem to apply, they did guide his attention in the search for a solution, a process thatin this rendering may seem much more protracted and analyt- ical than it actually was"
"First, he looked for a streetlight thatwould stop the trafﬁc, immediately ascertaining that there were none in sight"
"Next, he looked for a corner from which to cross, only to discover that, although some corners did in- deed have pedestrian crossing markings, the people driving the cars seemed to pay no attention to them, never stoppingor even reducing speed"
"Hesitating as to what to do next, he noticed that the native Romans were crossing the street, albeit quickly and with great agility, by simply wading intothe trafﬁc, crossing one lane at a time whenever even the smallest trafﬁc gap occurred, standing on the lane marker when their progress stalled, and moving ahead when anotheropening came"
"He watched for another minute, launched into the trafﬁc crossing as the natives had crossed, and soon foundhimself on the other side of the street"
Some of the same well-learned motor and sensory- perceptual skills acquired as part of his American street-crossing schema had served him well
"However, Ralph had learned a host of new things about crossing a street from his experience in Rome, changes in how he should propel him- self, staccato-style, across the street, attitudes about stepping into trafﬁc, signs that it was acceptable to force himself intotrafﬁc in this way, and appreciation of the drivers’ intentions to maneuver around pedestrians"
"In this new context, the how of crossing the street certainly had been changed"
"The speedwith which he had learned the new procedure was remark- able, reﬂecting some of his abilities as an athlete and his sangfroid in a new situation"
"By the time his wife, Bonnie,joined him from the States a few days later, he had become extremely adept at crossing the street and was surprised at her reluctance when he tried to take her hand and help hercross the street, Roman style"
She reacted by pulling her hand out of his with a look of alarm and resolutely remained stuck to the curb watching him show off his newly acquiredskill
"With all the differences between them relative to this particular learning occasion, it is perhaps not surprising that Bonnie resisted somewhat longer in adopting the “Roman”street-crossing routine, but soon came to see this response as necessary and not as life-threatening as she initially thought"
"To us, this case is a useful illustration of learning for multiple reasons"
We see that the what of the learning has many of the features of spontaneous concepts and actionsdiscussed earlier
Being nested in the current physical and cultural context of Rome and heeding the movements and behaviors of those around him proved sufﬁcient for Ralph—an experienced traveler—to master the art of Roman street crossing
"No formal instruction in this process was sought, and none was required"
"In terms of the where dimension, it is quite evident that these pedestrian conventions were not broadly generalizable but rather more closely tied to a given local context"
"Ralph and Bonnie knew immediately that totry crossing a street in Los Angeles, NewY ork, or London in the Roman way would lead to the disaster anticipated by Bonnie on her ﬁrst attempt in Rome"
"Still, there is everyreason to assume that Ralph and Bonnie will not soon forget"
"188 ALEXANDER, SCHALLERT, REYNOLDS the routine they had acquired, and this durability is further evidence that learning had, indeed, taken place"
Different aspects of this case would likely be appealing to those holding to diverse perspectives on learning
"For in- stance, situated cognitivists would ﬁnd intriguing Ralph’ sreading of the immediate context and of the affordances it provided and would focus on how and why Ralph responded as he did at that given moment"
"Conversely, a sociocultur-alist might be drawn to the street crossing routine that a “foreigner” might need to adopt in order to function within this environment, focusing on the coregulations occurringbetween walkers and drivers navigating the Via dei Fori Im- periali at the same time"
"A cognitive-constructivist might be interested in the knowledge that Ralph and Bonnie ac-quired from this experience, and how each of their existing conceptions of street crossing interacted with the new expe- rience and was changed, either moderately or radically, as aresult of this memorable occasion"
"A cognitive-evolutionist, by comparison, might be fascinated with the way in which Ralph, as representative of his species, had the capability to deal with the myriad of stimuli bombarding him in this mod- ern urban setting, to discern a sophisticated pattern withinthat myriad of stimuli, and to respond adroitly to the causal implications suggested by the emerging pattern in a manner that ensured his survival and achieved his goals"
"Case 3: Learning to Write an Academic Paper in a New Discipline In our third case, we focus on a critical task that students face when admitted to graduate school, learning how to write in ways deemed acceptable to the ﬁeld"
"Patricia’s ofﬁce at the University of Maryland is normally full of activity, with stu-dents and colleagues dropping by frequently to ask questions and share observations and insights"
"However, this apparentinformality belies the serious nature of the learning taking place"
"Like many doctoral students elsewhere, Patricia’s stu- dents must learn to write for publication in their ﬁeld and, forthose involved more closely in assisting her in her editorial duties, they must develop the skills and insights about aca- demic writing that come from being involved in the complexrole of editorial assistant"
"What Patricia’s students are required to master include the syntactic and stylistic conventions and regulations of pub- lishing in their ﬁeld (i.e., AP A style)"
"Learning to write for these doctoral students takes the form of frequent interac-tions around issues of publication, writing, and the selec- tion of appropriate publication outlets in an interactive cy- cle of generating ideas, interpreting research ﬁndings, draft-ing manuscripts, jointly critiquing and editing papers, and producing publication-ready manuscripts"
This cycle reoc- curs frequently as Patricia’s students learn the skills andconcepts necessary to help her in her editorial enterprises
Learning in this situation is the product of active participa-tion in the editorial process
"Students learn the imperative of meeting all editorial and production deadlines, the value of conceptual precision and writing clarity in their own and others’ manuscripts, and the importance of using appropri- ate methodological treatments of data"
"Even 1st-year studentslearn as they apprentice in the process, and they gain the ﬁner nuances of these general practices as they advance in their studies and participate in discussion, critique, and productioncycles"
"We included this case because the learning involved is different from that described in the ﬁrst two cases, cases thatdealt with learning at the levels of acquired habits and con- ditionings and of spontaneous concepts and actions"
"In the cherry pit and crossing the street cases, the learning occurredrather quickly, was more concrete than abstract, and required conscious effort for only a short to moderate duration"
"The learning described in this case ﬁts best into our third learninglevel, scientiﬁc concepts and practices"
"Hence, it illustrates learning that occurs over a long period requires considerable effort and involves a relatively high level of abstraction"
"Also, whereas learning in the ﬁrst two cases could be viewed as primarily individual and experiential, this level of learning isbest accomplished with the involvement of more knowledge- able others who can mentor the beginner across what may at times be very large gaps in knowledge"
"What Patricia’s students experience in the Disciplined Reading and Disciplined Learning Research Laboratory, the ways that emerging scholars learn to write for their disci-plinary community, has in fact been described frequently in the composition literature"
"For example, in a classic piece, Berkenkotter, Huckin, and Ackerman (1988) described thehistory of a doctoral student as he experienced the sometimes painful transformation of losing the style of his English lit- erature undergraduate major and acquiring appropriate waysof conceiving of evidence and presenting it adequately for a social science academic journal"
"As the student reported, there was a period during that 1st year of his academic stud-ies when he felt that he was losing himself even as he was learning what to attend to and how to write about it that made up his new discipline"
"Similarly, reporting on years of intensive observation and disciplined analysis, Fox (1994) delineated the difﬁcultiesthat international students experienced as they learned not only to adopt the style appropriate to their discipline but also the ways that feedback about writing was provided inthis country, self-assured, direct, even abrupt"
"Prior (1995) documented the processes in which a new graduate student engaged as she learned to write a conference proposal withher major advisor, at ﬁrst simply taking every suggestion as a sign that her advisor knew so much more than she did about what to say and how to say it in the proposal"
"Slowlyas she continued to work with her advisor, she acquired the knowledge of current issues in the ﬁeld, the language ap- propriate to their expression, and the conﬁdence to resist atleast some of the advisor’s suggestions as she came to know"
LEARNING TOPOGRAPHY 189 and care more about what was being said and how it was being said
We consider this progression in graduate students to be learning because students’ abilities to write are signiﬁcantly transformed over the span of a few years
Learning seemsclearly evident when graduate students move from turning in their ﬁrst course paper to the point of writing a ﬁrst- authored or sole-authored publication
"When they graduate,they eventually ﬁnd they can use the knowledge they have acquired in graduate school to guide their own students in the process of academic writing even as they continue tolearn their craft"
"What it is that a graduate student is learning about writing includes some aspects that may be relatively simple to master (e.g., style of citation format) as well asmore subtle and difﬁcult conventions for deciding how to frame an argument, whom to cite when doing so, which stance to indicate vis- `a-vis a particular ﬁnding, and when to deem any particular section of a paper as “done.” In essence, Patricia’s students have to learn how to deploy the scientiﬁc concepts and practices of their ﬁeld in their own writing"
These practices reﬂect historically situated and continually evolving conventions and standards for scholarly writings
"It is hard to imagine what facets of our third case a behav- iorist would ﬁnd informative or appealing, except perhaps to focus on the relation between the feedback students receiveand the accolades given (e.g., coauthorship) as critical rein- forcement that would sustain their efforts over the years"
"To a cognitive-contextualist, a student’s journey toward expertiseas a writer would prove especially compelling, particularly in terms of the transformations in knowledge, problem solving, and motivations that would unfold over the developmentalcourse"
"A socioculturalist would be interested in describing how students had appropriated the cultural practices of the ﬁeld (i.e., became enculturated), even as they changed notonly the local culture of the program but also, eventually, the wider culture as they achieved greater status within their ﬁeld"
"Perhaps for the social-constructivist, the scaffoldinginvited by students and provided by Patricia and more ad- vanced students during the graduate school experience would be the point of analysis in this learning case"
"To the cognitive- evolutionist, areas of interest would include students’ ability to adapt productively to this new situation, to set viable goals,and engage in activities to achieve them, to use background knowledge and innate capacities to understand and instanti- ate what they are learning"
"Of course, the outcomes of thislearning and their success in their new ﬁeld would enhance their ability to procure the necessities of survival, within a suitable academic institution"
"CONCLUDING THOUGHTS Our overarching intention in this analysis was to consider deeply the notion of learning and, in so doing, to advance a fresh perspective on this foundational construct as well asto offer a criterial framework against which theoretical per- spectives and empirical investigations on learning can be as- sessed"
"Throughout the discussion, we adopted the metaphor of a river system as a clear reminder that learning, like the river, operates as part of a dynamic system that is continu-ously and reciprocally transformed through the interactions of its constituent parts"
"Thus, understanding the essence of human learning demands a consideration of its primary di-mensions not as independent contributors to the products and processes of learning but as inseparable aspects of an intri- cate and ﬂuid system"
"We represented our understanding ofthe human learning in a topographical framework, a quad- rangulation based on the convergence of the what,where, who, and when dimensions of learning"
"Along with these in- teractive dimensions, our topographical mapping has as its legend nine principles of learning that are arguably core to all manner of perspectives, even those that consider distinct lev-els of learning (the whats) for diverse individuals (the who) learning at markedly different places (the where) and times (the when)"
"A value of our framework is that it disturbs existing views of learning, which remains a fundamental constructwithin educational theory and practice"
"The multidimen- sional framework we have advanced offers a different ap- proach to considering the views and assumptions of existing,even competing, perspectives on learning"
It does so by al- lowing us to position more precisely the purviews of these varied perspectives and thus appreciate better what they doand do not address about the nature of learning
"Moreover, our criterial framework allows us to understand that argu- ments among different theoretical perspectives may oftenreﬂect their theoretical geopositioning and, thus, their inabil- ity to see learning from the vantage point of rival “camps.” Thus, one perspective may be particularly helpful at describ-ing the acquisition of scientiﬁc concepts in children new to the cultural setting of school by means of the rich interplay with more knowledgeable, sometimes more powerful, othersin the setting (sociocultural views)"
"By contrast, another per- spective may prove more informative about the manner in which individuals acquire habits and conditionings through their interaction with the given environment and the stimuli it affords (behavior theory)"
"As stated, our intention was not simply to illustrate how varied and contrasting views of learning can coexist within the multidimensional map we constructed"
"Rather, we seethe resulting framework as serving an evaluative function as well"
"What the criterial framework reminds us is that existing perspectives differentially attend to the what,where,who, andwhen dimensions of learning"
"Further, to be regarded as comprehensive, we hold that some consideration of each of these dimensions is warranted"
"Should the what dimension be overlooked or the when dimension disregarded, then we would consider that perspective to be underspeciﬁed and, po- tentially, nonviable"
What the criterial framework also servesto remind us it that no “grand theory” of learning exists and
