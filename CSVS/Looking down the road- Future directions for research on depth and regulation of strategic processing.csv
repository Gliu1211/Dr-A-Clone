SENTENCES
will have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the extant literature and set a course for improved enhanced student learning and instructional practice
"Moreover, in concep-tualizing this issue, Dinsmore and Fryer not only sought international scholars withexpertise in this ﬁeld, but also individuals representing varied theoretical and method- ological traditions"
"For one, there are three overarching theoretical models referenced in the various articles,Approaches to Learning (ILS, Vermunt, 1994), the Model of Domain Learning (MDL,Alexander, 1997, 2003), and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL, Winne, 2010; Zimmerman &Schunk, 2011)"
"Further, as the editors promised, there are different populations, academicdomains, learning contexts, experimental measures, and statistical techniques repre-sented"
"In preparing my responses to this intriguing collection, I was taken by the editors’ choice of the word intersection in the title to situate the relation between levels and regulation of strategies, as well as approaches to learning"
That word evoked an image ofdistinct avenues of theory and research temporarily crossing paths and then continuing ontheir separate ways
My primary goal in thiscommentary was to look down the road to the next decade of theory and research onlearners’ strategic processing and approaches to learning and to forward recommenda-tions to those who are likely to pave the path that others will follow
"Yet, to accomplish this goal, there are initial steps that must be taken"
"First, it is necessary for me to ﬁnd evidence of intersection among these contributing authors who represent diverse perspectives and traditions regarding the depth andregulation of strategies and approaches to learning"
"By identifying these points ofconvergence, I will be better positioned to envision future directions"
"Second, I want topinpoint the obstacles researchers have encountered on their journey towards greaterunderstanding of the cognitive and metacognitive behaviours that learners manifest or theorientation towards learning they espouse"
"Some of those obstacles are apparent to anyone engaged in this research, whereas others are more embedded and, thus, harder to see and to avoid"
"Further, in certain cases, barriers to progress arise more often for oneresearch tradition, one learner population, or one academic domain than for another"
"Inother cases, these obstructions are common to all pursuing the goal of enhanced learningand academic development"
"However, they manifest or for whom, the drive to removethese obstacles will set a future course for these avenues of inquiry"
"Convergence of evidence Several years ago, I was negotiating the meaning of learning with Diane Schallert andRalph Reynolds (2009), who represent contrasting theoretical perspectives on thiscomplex construct"
It was then that I became reacquainted with writings of Wilson (1998)around consilience
"Drawing on philosophical work of Whewell (1840), credited withcoining the term consilience , Wilson (1998) argued that researchers should search for the unity of knowledge that emerges from the diverse perspectives or distinct methodologiesassociated with an important issue or construct"
"That unity of knowledge, in effect, represents a convergence of evidence; the empirical bedrock upon which inquiry should be based"
"I have subsequently employed this analytic technique on recent occasions whentrying to extract the essence of complex and controversial constructs, including relevance(Alexander, 2018) and reﬂectivity (Alexander, 2017)"
"Thus, when preparing my responseto this Special Issue, I returned to consilience once more"
shared by these scholars under the expectation that this area of convergence of evidence best captured what is known about depth and regulation of strategies and approaches tolearning
"As I quickly came to realize, there are indeed points of convergence among those who investigate strategies and those concerned with approaches to learning"
"Speciﬁcally, the common ground shared by the contributing authors to this Special Issue is as follows: There are discernible, non-random patterns in the way individuals and groups strategically engage in learning"
"Before the 20th century dawned, the pragmatist William James (1890) articulated signiﬁcant principles about human learning and development that remain relevant today.One of those principles related to humans’ tendency to habituate their thinking and behaviours"
"Regardless of age or background, individuals quickly establish routines that allow them to functionefﬁciently and effectively in the world"
This habituation manifests in the cognitive domainas much as in the physical or social realm
"Whether the contributors to this Special Issue are exploring cognitive or metacog- nitive/regulatory strategy use or approaches to learning, they apparently have taken as agiven that there are, in fact, reliable, predictable patterns (i.e., habits) in the way humansoperate in academic contexts"
"Moreover, these authors seemingly ascribe to the premise that, with the right measures and techniques, they can uncover those habits of thought and behaviour, quantify and analyse the results, and draw conclusions of educationalimportance"
"If these contributing authors did not believe that there are discernible, non-random patterns in the way individuals and groups strategically engage in learning, therewould be no reason to conduct the investigations represented in this Special Issue"
Individuals are able to describe their strategic behaviours or general approaches to learning with some consistency
"When it comes to discerning those habits of mind and behaviour to which I just referred, there is yet another commonality that emerges across the articles in this SpecialIssue"
"Speciﬁcally, contributing authors apparently accept the idea that the participants intheir studies, regardless of their ages, sociocultural backgrounds, or academic experi-ences, have an awareness of and an ability to articulate the procedures they are using, haveused, or typically use when engaged academically"
"In effect, these researchers operateunder the assumption that what is revealed during think-alouds, post-performance interviews, or questionnaires has sufﬁcient correspondence to what actually transpires to merit analysis"
"For instance, framing their study within self-regulated learning or SRL, Deekens, Greene, and Lobczowski (2018) re-analysed think-aloud data from two investigations asthe means to establish a statistical, if not a theoretical, relation between depth ofprocessing and frequency of monitoring and, ultimately, high-school and college students’performance on history and science tasks"
"(2018) used ﬁrst-year psychology students’ responses on the Inventory of Learning Patterns-Short Version (Donche & Van Petegem, 2008) to craft learner proﬁles"
Eye- tracking data were then gathered from a subgroup of the different proﬁles with the goal oflinking proﬁles to regulatory behaviour
researchers regarded what participants voiced or wrote as credible evidence of what was occurring inside their minds or what they routinely do when learning
"Another principle James (1890) articulated, which may at ﬁrst blush seem paradoxical with the notion of habitation, pertained to the uniqueness of human experience"
"Echoingthe pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who famously said that ‘No man ever steps in thesame river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man’, James contended that the continuous ﬂow of events humans experience ensure that no thought or action can ever be truly replicated"
"That is to say,thoughts and actions can repeat in an approximate way, being inevitably shaped by thechanging conditions within individuals or external to them"
The resulting pattern is stillrecognizable as a variant of what has occurred; just not an exact copy
"Certainly, this same principle applies to students’ strategic behaviour or approaches to learning"
"All learners may adopt certain processing rituals or routines, but those rituals androutines are expected to iterate as conditions internal or external to the learner shift"
"In fact, there are a various internal and external inﬂuences mentioned by the contributing authors, such as learner characteristics (e.g., topic knowledge or domain interest),speciﬁc task features (e.g., complexity or structuredness of the task), and performancevenue (e.g., on computer or in history or science classrooms)"
"For example, Fryer and Vermunt (2018) used Latent Proﬁle Transition Analysis to examine the proﬁles of Japanese students at the beginning and end of their ﬁrst year atcollege"
"Data for this analysis came from select scales measuring deep and surface approaches to learning and three modes of regulation (i.e., self, external, and lack of)"
"Relevant to the claim of strategic iteration, Fryer and Vermunt determined that fourproﬁles captured the data effectively at the beginning of the school year –Low Quality, Low Quantity, Average, and High Quantity"
"By the end of the school year, while themembership of the Average and Low Quality proﬁles remained quite stable, there was anoticeable shift in membership for students initially populating the High and LowQuantity proﬁles"
The authors had not anticipated this pattern in ‘movers’ and ‘stayers’ and explored a number of possible explanations for their ﬁndings
One of those explanations was internal to the students and centred on the possible adequacy of the Average groups approaches tolearning and regulatory behaviours for the academic context
"Another, which was moreexternal in form, posited that the movers from High Quantity to Low Quality or Averagegroups may reﬂect ‘friction between their strategy use and the expectations of theenvironment’ (p"
The prevailing cultural within Japanese higher education was alsodiscussed as an external force that may have exerted inﬂuence on these students’approaches to learning and regulatory behaviours
"Investigating strategies through the lens of the MDL (Alexander, 1997, 2003), Parkinson and Dinsmore (2018) considered the inﬂuence of readers’ domain-speciﬁcknowledge and interest on their text processing"
Their ﬁndings revealed how quality morethan quantity of high-school students’ strategy use was at issue
"Further, certain studentsrelied more on their knowledge base than others, and it mattered whether the text theyread was expository or persuasive in form"
"Scheiter, Schubert, and Sch €uler, 2018 also focused on the role of knowledge in strategic processing"
These researchers wanted to determine whether a substantialDepth and regulation of strategies 155
amount of domain knowledge would override university students’ use of a particular technique shown to be effective with elementary students’ reading of multimedia texts.The Eye Movement Modeling Examples (EMME) technique they implemented involvesshowing participants videos of the eye gaze patterns of skilled learners studying texts containing pictures or graphs as a visual model
"As they hypothesized, these authors found that those with a substantial base of content knowledge did not follow the recommendedeye-tracking pattern when integrating text and visual media"
"There is a positive association between depth and frequency of strategy use, on the one hand, and regulatory behaviours and academic outcomes on the other"
"Perhaps the most salient point of convergence for the authors in this Special Issue is the reasonable presumption that it is desirable for students of all ages and backgrounds to manifest those thoughts and behaviours indicative of deeper processing with regularity, regardless of the task or domain with which they are engaged"
"Moreover, there is theacknowledgement that such depth of processing is intertwined with the regulation ormonitoring of performance and tied to better learning or task outcomes"
Dinsmore and Zoellner (2018) tackled this very idea directly in their investigation of the interplay between deeper or more surface-level cognitive strategies and metacogni-tive strategies and college students’ performance in a science simulation task
What theiranalyses revealed was that considering only the depth and frequency of cognitive strategies did not adequately explain the outcomes
"Ultimately, what they determined through smallest space analysis was that students’ outcomes on a climate simulation taskwas best captured by cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of functioning and certain clusters of strategies that manifest within that multidimensional space"
(2018) used think-aloud data from high-school and college students to explore the relations between the depth and frequency of cognitive strategyuse and the frequency of regulatory behaviour
concluded that focusing only on depth or frequency of strategy use was insufﬁcient to represent the nature of effective learning in those studies
This association between the cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of learning and academicperformance that Deekens et al
and Dinsmore and Zoellner empirically investigated is theoretically addressed by Winne (2018)
"Speciﬁcally, Winne draws on his decades ofresearch on SRL to illustrate how depth and levels of strategic processing play out acrossthe phases of his model of self-regulated learning"
He also deconstructs the notion of depthof processing as it is frequently used in the literature –an issue I will revisit in this commentary
"Additional insights Beyond these key principles shared by the contributors, I want to brieﬂy touch uponadditional insights I was able to extract from the collective works comprising this SpecialIssue"
I offer these here as important reminders of what are currently held as ‘truths’ aboutthe process of learning
"Simply stated, I would summarize those insights as follows: Learning is ultimately a complex, multifaceted, and dynamic process that cannot be fully represented by any one theoretical framework, set of beliefs, or cluster of processes.156 Patricia A"
"The more that educational psychologists or learning scientist come to understand of the process of learning or about learners, the more they appreciate that they will never beable to capture the nature of this fundamental human activity in its entirety"
"At best, theycan attempt to richly and accurately describe certain dimensions or mechanisms of that process in such a way as to enlighten students, teachers, educational leaders, and policymakers"
"Certainly, ILS, the MDL, and SRL are theoretical frameworks that highlightimportant facets of learning and academic development, but they are by no means all-encompassing"
"This fact was made apparent in each article by the constraints, challenges,and limitations the authors dutifully acknowledged"
There are diverse ways to unearth and examine what learners ‘do’ or ‘think they are doing’
"When Wilson (1998) forwarded the concept of consilience, he argued that it was surely possible that researchers using very diverse methodologies and approaching aproblem from different theoretical frameworks can arrive at similar conclusions"
"Whether thesescholars relied on data from think-alouds, questionnaires, simulation programmes, retrospective interviews; gathered real-time physiobiological indicators or regulatory trace data; or used variable-centred or person-centred analyses, their ﬁndings intersectto some degree"
There are relevant distinctions to be made among the processes involved in learning and academic performance
"Throughout this Special Issue, contributors found it empirically necessary to identify different forms or levels of learning processes"
"Thus, readers will encounter references to processes that are deep versus surface or shallow; cognitive versus metacognitive versus regulatory; routine versus intentional; and general versus domain-speciﬁc"
Thislitany of terms is signiﬁcant in that it conveys that effective learning and academicperformance entail layers or categories of procedures that differ in theoretically andpractically important ways that demand empirical consideration
"Thus, it matterswhether the learner is executing a particular mental procedure in task performance(cognitive) or monitoring whether that procedure is functioning effectively (metacog-nitive or self-regulatory)"
It matters whether students are enacting procedures that allow them to make sense of a problem or task (surface) or to critically analyse its form or content (deep)
Effective learning and academic performance require the orchestration of skills and strategies at varying levels or in different categories
"While it is crucial to acknowledge procedural distinctions that manifest in learning and academic performance, it is equally important to appreciate that it is the orchestration of these procedures that ultimately leads to effective outcomes (Dinsmore & Alexander, 2012)"
"For instance, it would be easy to construe that deep strategies are somehowsuperior to surface strategies or that cognitive and metacognitive processes functionseparately"
"Yet, all learners at all levels of expertise employ both surface and deepstrategies according to the MDL (Alexander, 1997, 2003), and there is a continual interplaybetween cognitive and metacognitive processes as the models and research in self-regulated learning establish (Hadwin & Winne, 2001; Winne, 1982).Depth and regulation of strategies 157"
Lingering concerns I would not be performing my role as commentator for this Special Issue well if I simplyidentiﬁed the shared principles and important insights that the authors of these articleshave contributed to the knowledge base on levels and regulation of strategies and approaches to learning
I must also look critically at these intersecting literatures and what remains as barriers to achieving even greater understanding of learning and academicperformance
These barriers are not conﬁned to any one theoretical framework orprogramme of research
"Rather, these conundrums impede progress for all researchers onthis journey to understand human learning and academic development, and they havedone so for decades"
"A muddled distinction between strategic and skilful behaviour Strategies are the centrepiece for this Special Issue and a key component in the theoretical frameworks referenced (e.g., ILS, MDL, and SRL)"
"Further, strategic processing is a concept that is often discussed within the instructional literature asessential for normally developing and id entiﬁed populations (Graham, Harris, & Mason, 2005; Pressley & Harris, 2008) acro ss grades and academic domains"
"Yet, wh a tex ac tl yco unt sa sas tr a teg yan dwh at does not remain problematic"
"That is why there are those who have sought to differentiate these procedures from skills(Afﬂerbach, Pearson, & Paris, 2008; Alexan der, Grossnickle Peterson, Dumas, & Hattan, in press)"
"For example, in our perspective on strategy research, Karen Harris, Steve Graham, and I (1998) claimed that strategies have six speciﬁc attributes"
"‘Speciﬁcally, strategies can beunderstood as procedural ,purposeful ,effortful ,willful ,essential , and facilitative ’ (p"
This characterization was used to delineate the parameters between strategies and skills
"Although there are indeed certain characteristics that strategies and skills share (e.g., they both forms of procedural knowledge), there are at least two signiﬁcant differences"
"Thesedifferences pertain to the automaticity of performance and to learner awareness orintentionality ....In effect, skills are procedures that have been routinized"
"That is, students hone these techniques to a level of automaticity, enabling them to perform a given task ﬂuidly and effectively"
"Skills are the ‘habits’ of performance, or what a learner typically does (James,1890)"
135) Others have similarly differentiated between strategies and skills (Afﬂerbach et al
", 2008; Paris, Lipson, & Wixson, 1983) and have also bemoaned the confounding of these terms within the educational literature"
Such problems may arise from researchers’ failure to explicitly deﬁne these terms or treat them as synonyms
"Thus, it would appear that theconfounding of strategic and skilful processing remains a barrier for those investigatingthe levels and regulation of strategies, and approaches to learning, albeit it for differentreasons"
"For instance, in the case of research into ILS, where individuals attempt to accurately represent the typical way they engage academically, there is no mechanism to ascertain whether respondents are describing automated routines or more intentional actions"
"Perhaps that is why Fryer and Vermunt (2018) wisely chose McKeachie, Pintrich, andLin’s (1985,p"
154) purposely broad deﬁnition of learning strategies as ‘cognitions or158 Patricia A
behaviours that inﬂuence the encoding process and facilitate acquisition and retrieval of new knowledge’ to guide their work
chose this deﬁnition precisely to sidestep the complications of trying to adhere to the theoretical distinctions between strategies and skills in instructional practice
"Within the MDL, the clarity that exists theoretically between strategies and skill is likewise problematized when it comes to discerning what isroutine versus intentional enactment in actual performance"
The empirical tools that areavailable simply do not allow for that critical determination in most cases
"Thus, beyondplacing a learner in a novel situation, like the climate simulation used by Dinsmore andZoellner (2018), there is little assurance that what one is witnessing is either a well-honedroutine or a purposeful and effortful response to a speciﬁc problem"
"Different speciﬁcations as to what counts as surface or deep strategies It is not only the problem of distinguishing between strategies and skills that hampers progress in the study of learning and academic performance, but also the issue of reliablyidentifying surface versus deep processes"
"As I read the articles in this issue, what I found were similar designations applied to different procedures"
What constituted a surface- level strategy in one study was considered a deep strategy in another
The article by Parkinson and Dinsmore (2018) draws directly from the MDL in the manner in which surface-level and deep strategies are deﬁned and identiﬁed in their studyof high-school students’ reading of expository or persuasive texts
"Speciﬁcally, Parkinsonand Dinsmore deﬁned surface-level strategies as processes aimed at making sense of theproblem, such as underlining or rereading text"
"Deep strategies, by comparison, weredeﬁned as those used to integrate or transform –and I would add evaluate –the text or the content being conveyed by the text"
"In a somewhat related vein, Fryer and Vermunt (2018) discussed surface and deep approaches to learning more in terms of learners’ goals or aims than in relation toprocedures they are using to accomplish a task"
"Thus, surface approaches focus onremembering what is required for a task and deep approaches are more about achievingunderstanding"
"From the sample items they provide for surface (e.g., I concentrate onlearning just those bits of information I have to know to pass.) and deep approaches (e.g., Ioften ﬁnd myself thinking about ideas from my course when I’m doing other things.), I saw some correspondence to performance and mastery goals in the achievement motivation literature (Midgley, Kaplan, & Middleton, 2001)"
"To these two views on level or depth of processing, Winne (2018) offers yet another that reﬂects the perceived difﬁculty of instructional objectives for a given task"
"This view isperhaps best exempliﬁed by the taxonomy of educational objectives in the cognitivedomain ﬁrst articulated by Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl (1956) andsubsequently updated by Anderson et al"
"Broadly speaking, what this concep- tualization does is assign a level of cognitive demand to the processing speciﬁed as an instructional aim"
"So, the ‘comprehension’ (understanding) level is held as deeper than the ‘knowledge’ (memorization) level, but less cognitively demanding than the goal ofsynthesizing"
This discussion also points out that confusion remains about notions of leveland depth that interfere with continued progress
Overreliance on self-report measures and spotty connections to academic outcomesDepth and regulation of strategies 159
Two other barriers that have long impeded research into levels and regulation of strategic processing and approaches to learning pertain to data sources and outcomemeasures
"For one, those engaged in this research too often must rely solely on therecollections, reﬂections, explanations, and interpretations of participants"
"The limita- tions of self-report data, whether gathered through think-alouds, interviews, question- naires, or focus reports, have been well documented (Tourangeau, 2000; White, 1988).Although there are steps that can be taken to increase their reliability (Ericsson & Simon,1998), the total reliance on self-report data remains problematic"
"For another, when researchers, like those contributing to this Special Issue, are ultimately concerned with the facilitation of students’ learning and academic develop-ment, it is reasonable to expect that the studies they conduct include academic outcomes.Further, those outcome measures should relate to valued conceptual and procedural content, and the design of studies should allow for more causal rather than correlational judgements"
"In essence, if students’ levels and regulation of strategies or their espousedapproaches to learning do not lead to improved learning or academic performance, thenwhy should they ultimately matter to those expected to enact or manifest them"
"Thankfully, for the contributors to this Special Issue, indicators of learning appear integral to their research designs –from solving climate simulation problems and answering questions about expository and persuasive text to performance on tests on celldivision or the circulatory system"
"Thus, until researchers routinely show evidence of learning and performance effects, this unnecessary obstruction will remain"
"More attention to the role of learner characteristics As discussed, it is widely accepted that internal factors play a signiﬁcant role in strategic and regulatory behaviours and approaches to learning"
"For instance, in thisSpecial Issue, this is evident in terms of the role of topic or domain knowledge in the depthand frequency of strategy use (Parkinson & Dinsmore, 2018; Scheiter, et al"
"In the light of this fact, it is surprising how often those undertaking research on cognitive orregulatory behaviours or approaches to learning fail to systematically gather data onparticipants and use those data in their analyses"
"Minimally, prior knowledge measuresshould be routinely gathered, along with indicators of task/domain familiarity or motivations"
"Moreover, beyond data on students’ knowledge of or motivations towards the task, topic, or domain, it may be pertinent to measure such executive functions as workingmemory or relational reasoning that could signiﬁcantly inﬂuence performance on certaincognitive tasks"
"For example, such executive functions may well have contributed toparticipants’ performance on the climate simulation task in the Dinsmore and Zoellner(2018) study or the strategic processing of the high-school students in Parkinson andDinsmore (2018) investigation, over and above knowledge and interest"
"Consequently, the more that researchers know about the participants in their studies, the better positioned they are to interpret their outcomes"
(2018) reached when their EMME intervention did not have the predicted effects on learning outcomes
"As they reported, ‘weaker studentsshowed even poorer recall of the information after having watched EMME, whereas recallperformance of stronger students was unaffected by the experimental manipulation’(p"
If these researchers had not wisely measured students’ general scientiﬁc literacy160 Patricia A
"and their knowledge of cell division, the absence of a learning effect would have remained a puzzlement"
"A good deal of other- or coregulation within the self-regulation literature Although I have directed many of my comments to research on levels of strategic processing and approaches to learning, there is one barrier that is particular to theliterature on SRL"
"This concern, which others have recognized (Dinsmore, Alexander, &Loughlin, 2008; Winters & Alexander, 2011; Winters, Greene, & Costich, 2008), represents a conceptual and operational confound"
"Speciﬁcally, in much of the research that purports to explore the relation of self-regulation to learning and academicperformance, there are explicit questions or prompts requiring monitoring or regulationposed by a researcher, teacher, or peer"
"Such scaffolds have also been incorporated incomputer-based learning environments or CBLEs (Azevedo, Cromley, Winters, Moos, &Greene, 2005)"
"(2005) study, Microsoft Encarta materials on the circulatory system, like those used by Deekens et al"
"(2018), were modiﬁed to test the effects of three kinds of scaffolds embedded in the CBLE"
"What is relevant to this commentary is that these researchers discussed their procedures and outcomes in termsofself-regulation, despite the fact that their participants displayed no self-initiated regulation"
"Thus, if researchers are going to want to investigate the role of regulatoryprocesses in learning and academic performance, then they need to be more precise in theforms of regulation operating in those environments (e.g., self, other, peer)"
Future directions I would like to bring this commentary to a close by humbly suggesting viable ways toaddress the barriers just described
"I do so because I think that decreasing or removing these obstacles that have long been impediments will not only facilitate progress along the paths already established, but may also open new avenues of inquiry"
"Moreover, Iexpressly direct my suggestions to the Special Issue contributors and others activelyengaged in research pertaining to strategies and approaches to learning, because Istrongly feel that these scholars possess the expertise and experience required toundertake the innovations needed to enact these recommendations"
"In addition, thosewho identify with such frameworks as the MDL, ILS, and SRL can pave the way on some ofthe ontological and methodological issues entailed in these recommendations, then it is more likely that others within their communities of practice will follow"
More clearly establish the conceptual boundaries between skilful and strategic performance and seek out or devise measures and procedures that align with the resulting conceptual- izations
Just the act of explicating the constructs that guide this research and achieving some degree of consensus as to their meaning will be a major advancement for studies thatinvolve cognitive and metacognitive or regulatory strategies
This would especially be thecase if individuals consistently referenced these terms in the design and reporting of theirresearch
"Moreover, understanding how routinized versus intentional procedures situate within the work on approaches to learning, which focuses on general orientations more than speciﬁc processes, should also prove enlightening.Depth and regulation of strategies 161"
Employing or creating experimental tools and procedures that work in concert with those conceptualdeﬁnitions is another
"There is unquestionably a need for those with the knowledgeand creativity to devise alternative techniques and tasks, develop novel measures, and construct new learning environments that permit researchers to disentangle typical from adaptive responses to academic tasks"
"For example, were researchers able to establish anindividual’s procedural baseline for a familiar and easy reading task and then track thatindividual’s processing for a reading task that was novel or appreciably more difﬁcult, theywould have an inkling of how that individual performs both skilfully and strategically.Certainly, there must be creative ways yet to be discovered that would allow for thedistinctions between skills and strategies that are theoretically signiﬁcant to be accuratelyidentiﬁed in practice"
Aim for greater consensus as to what the various levels or classes of strategies signify and focus on those differences in subsequent studies
"Just as I am calling for greater consistency in the use of the designations strategy and skill, I am recommending that those who engage in research where the levels or depth of strategic process are relevant to ﬁnd common ground as to what the notion of depthmeans and what actions might typically fall at various levels"
"Although I can appreciate theargument that Winne (2018) forwards regarding the multiple ways in which depth can be calculated (i.e., the aim of the process, the perceived difﬁculty of the cognitive target, or the demands of the task), I do consider that multiplicity as bypassing the necessity forconsistency"
"If anything, the added complexity Winne outlines heightens the need toconsider the typography of ‘depth’ carefully and label its multiple dimensions accord-ingly"
"Beyond the issues of levels, there are other categorical labels appearing in this Special Issue that might also beneﬁt from deﬁnitional scrutiny"
"For instance, it would seem thatthe literature has already tackled the cognitive versus metacognitive and regulatory designations (Dinsmore & Alexander, 2012; Dinsmore et al ., 2008; Garner, 1987)"
"Of course,the relation between metacognition and self-regulation and between self-regulation andself-regulated learning, which have been cause for concern in the past, may still demandattention and oversight from those best positioned to understand whatever thesubtleties of those relations"
Base ﬁndings on more than self-report data and include measures of learning and academic performance whenever possible
"Perhaps one of the clearest recommendations I would forward to this research community is to strive to incorporate data that are not solely reliant on the recollections,reﬂections, explanations, and interpretations of study participants"
"I do not mean tosuggest that well-established questionnaires or measures, like the ILS, or often employedtechniques, like think-alouds, are problematic"
"To the contrary, these are valuable tools forthose engaged in research on levels and regulation of strategies and approaches to learning"
"Rather, what I am recommending is that these tools should be combined with other more objective measures"
"Additionally, as researchers consider the various measures they will make central to their studies, I strongly recommend that relevant learning and achievement outcomes162 Patricia A"
"What aspects of learning and academic performance are measured and the speciﬁc form those outcomes take is not at issue, provided that they are wellmatched to the study goals and are psychometrically sound"
"Thus, these outcomes can bedomain-general or domain-speciﬁc, commercially produced or researcher developed, and focused on immediate and direct effects or delayed and transfer effects"
Build rich proﬁles on study participants that can be potentially applied in person-centred analyses or in the interpretation of variable-centred analyses
It is a truism to say that learners are an essential component in any study of learning and academic performance
"Yet, as just discussed, researchers often provide limited data ontheir participants even though those data could be pivotal to the questions theyinvestigate"
"In the future, therefore, I am strongly recommending that researchers carefully weigh what characteristics of the individuals should be part of the design calculus"
"When it comes to questions of learning and academic development, knowledgeof the domain or topic, relevant experiences, learner goals and interests, domain-speciﬁcabilities, general cognitive capacity, working memory, and relational reasoning are amongthe data points that merit consideration"
"Along with commonly gathered information onage, gender, and ethnicity, such individual difference factors would allow researchers tobetter interpret the patterns within their data in variable-centred analysis (Parkinson &Dinsmore, 2018; Scheiter et al"
"Moreover, rich data on learners could be applied in person-centred analyses, including cluster analysis and latent proﬁle analysis (Fryer & Vermunt, 2018)"
"Self-regulation is unquestionably a foundational process in learning and academic performance, and the empirical literature on self-regulated learning is clearly substantialand informative"
"Within that literature, there are those who have tackled the question ofthe development of self-regulation (Demetriou, 2000; Pressley, 1995)"
"What thesescholars consider are questions of when in the course of a students’ academic life (e.g., ageor grade level) and under what conditions (e.g., knowledge base, prior experiences, levelof self-efﬁcacy, and supportive instructional environment) are learners likely to manifestself-regulatory behaviours"
"What is less well understood, however, is how learners transition from other regulation to self-regulation"
"What I am recommending, therefore, are studies that focus on this developmental trajectory"
"That is, how do students of varying ages or backgrounds take the externalprompts and scaffolds embedded within classroom or computer-based environments orprovided by teachers, peers, or others and internalize them; make them their own"
Whendoes external scaffolding become unnecessary or even distracting for learners who havedeveloped the ability and tendency to self-scaffold or who come to a learning task with theknowledge and interest to engage in self-monitoring
Concluding thoughts What I hope I have achieved in this commentary is a successful mapping of thecommon ground shared by the scholars represented in this Special Issue
This common ground arises from converging evidence found within the diverse theoreticalDepth and regulation of strategies 163
