SENTENCES
masking significant epistemological distinctions of rele - vance to conceptual change research and practice
"For in - stance, when we use the term “cognition” to mark a theoreti - cal stance, are we talking about the approaches associated with radical constructivism (von Glaserfeld, 1991), informa - tion-processing theory (Simon, 1989), or cognitive constructivism (Piaget, 1926, 1930)"
"Similarly, when an ap - proach to learning and teaching is categorized as socio - cultural is one envisioning social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978), situated cognition or situativity (Greeno, 1989;Greeno & the Middle School Mathematics Through Applica - tion Project Group, 1998), or theory more aligned to social or cultural anthropology (Lave, 1988; Lave & Wenger, 1991;Rogoff, 1990)"
"All of the aforementioned theories and their innumerable iterations can be differentiated in multiple ways, includingepistemologically (i.e., views on the nature and source ofknowledge)"
"Further, such epistemological differences makethis bonding process seemingly unnecessary or unachiev - able"
I am not alone in my contention that epistemology mat - ters in this cross-perspective dialogue
Several of the authors readily admit that questions about the nature of knowledgeare paramount to this hoped-for partnership
"For instance, asa frame for her argument,V osniadou (2007) wrote thatthe“main difference between the two perspectives [i.e., cog-nitive and sociocultural] is their position on the ontologicalstatus of knowledge” (p"
"Similarly, Murphy (2007)stated that “sociocultural and cognitive perspectives hold toepistemically different views on knowledge acquisition andchange” (p"
"For example, do researchers in conceptual change, as with the philosophers of decades past, assume that knowledgearises solely or primarily through rational thought (i.e., acognitive construction) or through empiricism aided by so - cial interactions situated within a specific time and place (i.e., a sociocultural construction), or some combinationthereof"
"Moreover, where does knowledge ultimately residefor those in these varied cognitive or sociocultural positions?Is it found in mental structures of the mind (i.e., mental repre - sentation or models) or is it nested in the environment or alive only in group interactions (i.e., situated phenomena)?Halldén, Haglund, and Strömdahl (2007) put forward thisvery fundamental quandary at the conclusion of their articlewhen they stated that “there is the debate whether knowledgeis to be looked upon as personal and residing within the indi - vidual or if it is embraced within discursive practices and cul - tural tools” (p"
The intersection of these basic questions about where knowledge comes from and where it resides creates anepistemological space that serves to frame the array oflearning theories
"For the sake of discussion, I offer a tenta - tive placement of several learning theories within this mul - tidimensional space (see Figure 1), including those related to the programs of research presented in this special issue.Of course, I do so with the understanding that others maywell position these theories differently"
"Nonetheless, within this multidimensional space, we encounter theories thatgive primacy to the individual mind as both the constructorof knowledge and its repository (e.g., radical con-structivism)"
"In contrast, there are those theories that locateboth the source and location of knowledge, or more pre - cisely knowing, within the immediate social context and human interactions (e.g., socioculturalism)"
"For the currentdiscussion, I refer to these more extremely positionedlearning theories, be they cognitive or sociocultural, as“hard perspectives.” Between these more extreme epistemological stances, we can position the majority of learning theories and programsof research on conceptual change"
"Although some of thesetheoretical orientations lean more heavily on the side of theindividual mind, as shown in Figure 1, either in terms of thesource or the location of knowledge (e.g., information pro - cessing or cognitive constructivism), others tend more to - ward the social end of the multidimensional space (e.g., so - cial constructivism or situated cognition)"
It is precisely these leanings that Greeno and van de Sande metaphorically depictwhen they describe a bridge that could be built more fromone side of the riverbank or the other
Regardless of the dis - proportionate contributions of the builders that bridge would eventually connect the cognitive and sociocultural sides ofthe epistemological debate
It is this collection of more mod - erate theories that I place under the category of “soft perspec - tives.”68 ALEXANDER FIGURE 1 The epistemological positioning of learning theories.
SOFT VERSUS HARD PERSPECTIVES Why engage in such theoretical sorting and sifting as the framework for the discussion of the articles presented in thisspecial issue
It is to support my argument that those whorepresent the soft perspectives do not have to build bridgesbetween cognitive and sociocultural orientations
That is be - cause those orientations could not exist without the acknowl - edgment of the other bank of the river
To extend Greeno and van de Sande’s metaphor: A river without two banks ceasesto be a river
"So, how are we to judge whether the stances to - ward knowledge taken by the authors in this special issue are indicative of the soft or hard perspective"
"One way is to sub - ject the ideas forwarded by the contributing authors to critical questions related to conceptualization, sociocultural influ - ences, and truth"
"First, we can begin to triangulate these authors’ positions by ascertaining whether their perspectives allow for concep - tualization at all"
"If there is no place for the existence of a concept or the formation of concepts in any manner, thenthere is no reason to even hope for a theoretical bridging.Second, beyond the minimal test of whether there is accep - tance of conceptualization, it becomes essential to considerwhether there is a “reality” or “truth” to which a person’s orgroup’s understanding can be judged"
"In effect, if all notions are of equal merit and require no further development or jus-tification relative to accepted or validated understandings,then there is no reason to engage in the exploration of con-ceptual change from either bank of the theoretical river"
"Finally, just as it is essential to acknowledge the existence of concepts and levels of truth or accuracy in conceptions toqualify as a soft perspective, it is also requisite to perceive so-cial and cultural forces as influences on understanding, how - ever strong or weak"
"If thought or the formation of concepts can proceed without consideration of sociocultural forces,then we are again faced with the futility of building a bridgetoward the social side of our river"
"So, how do our authors stack up on these questions of con - ceptualization, truth, and sociocultural influences"
"Do they, in effect, qualify as softer or harder perspectives on thechange process, and where would I position them in thatepistemological space I previously described"
"I found theGreeno and van de Sande and theV osniadou articles to be themost obvious points of contrast on these issues, particularlybecause they were cast somewhat as epistemological pointand counterpoint"
"For instance, in the situations they pose and the language they employ, I envision Greeno and van de Sande (2007)standing firmly on the sociocultural side of our river but witha hand metaphorically outstretched toward the cognitiveshore"
"As a case in point, these authors avoid the use of suchterms as mind and knowledge and seek to redefine the notionof concepts as perspectival understandings"
"In fact, “mind”appears only once in their article and in that case the term wasused to distinguish the cognitive perspective on conceptualchange from their unique perspective"
"When mentioned, al - beit infrequently, “knowledge” is viewed as between rather than within individuals, with conceptual understanding and conceptual growth portrayed as functions “accomplished byactivity systems and communities of practice” (p"
Itwould appear therefore that conceptualization has a placewithin Greeno and van de Sande’s perspective but only whenit comes to the source of knowledge
"There appears to be nomovement toward the cognitive side of the river when thetopic turns to the question of where knowledge resides.V osniadou voiced similar concern with the Greeno and vande Sande perspective when she argued that “knowledge mustbe seen not only as a process but also as a product, an objectto be taught” (p"
"As to the issue of truth or accuracy, Greeno and van de Sande offer support for the need for conceptual growth or un - derstanding, although the idea of a misconception does not arise in their discussion"
"Specifically, their criterion for any“truth” judgment pertains to “following accepted proceduresand terminology with authority vested in the discipline” (p.12)"
One is said to act with conceptual agency when a positivecontribution is made to that disciplinary group or communityof practice
"To play off of Murphy’s creative title in this issue,truth for Greeno and van de Sande is in the eyes of the behold-ers"
"Thus, given the primacy for sociocultural influences, ac-ceptance of a distributed conception, and the collective judg-ment of truth, I have placed Greeno and van de Sande squarelywithin the sociocultural quadrant with some drift toward thecognitive side of the proverbial river (see Figure 2)"
"In contrast,V osniadou (2007) does not shy away from the idea of concepts or the mind as repository of knowledge;both are essential to her theoretical perspective"
"Nonetheless,she readily accepts that such concepts are directly affected bysociocultural forces and are therefore not only changing andchangeable, but also socially distributed"
"Quoting Hatano(1994), she concurs that while “understanding is a social pro - cess, it also involves much processing by an active individual mind.” The symbolic structures that are essential in the pro - cess of conceptual change forV osniadou can exist internally in the mind of the individual or be found in the context or en - vironment (e.g., globe)"
"As with Greeno and van de Sande, she vests thedisciplinary community with much of the power to judgethe verisimilitude of individuals’ mental representations.Through orchestrated and positive instructional experiences,students may abandon their more naïve or synthetic mentalmodels for those that more closely approximate accepted sci - entific models"
"Thus, based on her detailed explanation, it is not hard to positionV osniadou within the more cognitivequadrant but with clear advances toward the socioculturalside of the river, especially when the question pertains to thesource of knowledge"
"The other two contributors to this volume can be found more to the center of this multidimensional space, or some-where in the middle of the river to use Greeno and van deSande’s metaphor"
"(2007), the mechanismthat illuminates the necessity of a dual cognitive-socio-cultural perspective on conceptual change arises in attemptsto unearth and interpret individuals’ mental representations.As they explain: Rather than regarding interview data as mirroring some sort of conceptual structure related to the mind, or some sort ofmental processing, we look at the answers as indicating whatthe interviewee is trying to accomplish in the interview situa - tion"
"Thus, the object of analysis is verbal actions rather than utterances regarded as overt representations of thoughts ormental processes"
It is by identifying these actions that wecan make inferences about the agent’s knowledge and experi - ences
31–32) The casting of concepts in words that communicate by the in - terviewee and the efforts to interpret and affix meaning to those utterances by the interviewer is a social act nested in aparticular context
The question of the correctness or accuracy of individuals’ conception is a bit more problematic to assess in Halldén etal.’s contribution
"Although there is concern for coherence orcorrectness, much of that focus rests on the match betweenthe individuals’ true understanding and those extrapolatedthrough the interview process"
"Nonetheless, it would seemthat Halldén et al., as with Greeno and van de Sande, privi - lege the conceptions or perspectives of the scientific commu -nity in ascertaining the naiveté or sophistication of conceptu - alizations"
"locate knowledge or understanding in the mind of the individual butascribe the process of knowing to sociocultural factors plac - ing them more toward the social constructivism aligned with Vygotsky (1986, 1978)"
"Finally, Murphy (2007) has forwarded an interesting, al - beit complex, model of change that is informed by the philo - sophical debate between rationalism and empiricism, and that places beliefs as much as knowledge at the foreground ofthe change process"
"In this way, both Murphy andV osniadouhave sought to reframe discussion of conceptual change asthe process of transforming beliefs as much as knowledge.What seems apparent is that the mind remains the sole repos - itory of knowledge for Murphy, who does not even broach the topic of distributed understanding as doesV osniadou"
"Yet, while Murphy seeks to move the consideration of conceptual change deeper into the thoughts and beliefs of theindividual, she does so by not only recognizing that there arelevels of understanding that must be acknowledged (i.e.,knowledge of, knowledge about , and knowledge that), but also by strongly weighing both rational thought andsociocultural experiences as critical catalysts for shifts inknowing and believing"
Recognition of these internal repre-sentations and rationalizations and the external catalytic ex-periences are evidenced in her concluding remarks when shewrites: I have urged those interested in change to acknowledge truth as seen through eyes of students and to initiate experiencesand conversations that encourage students to expose and jus-tify their own understandings
"51) Moreover, Murphy sits at the crux of the multidimensional grid in terms of the issue of truth or accuracy"
"That is becauseher model accepts that there can be varied paths for justifica - tion for students, any of which can lead to justified true be - liefs (i.e., knowledge) or prove fallible in that regard"
"For the rationalist the source [of knowledge] is innate ideas and reasoning about those thoughts and ideas, and for the em - piricist the source is sense experience"
"Soldiers for both sides claim that their source of knowledge leads to accurate under - standings about the world (i.e., truths)"
"Yet, there is no con - flict when it comes to acknowledging that either path to truth can be precarious or fallible"
"That is, even if internal reason - ing is the source of knowledge, there remains the possibility that one could introduce misconceptions due to problems inreasoning"
"In essence, for neither ap - proach can we be certain that the ways in which individuals conceptually represent the world actually correspond to theways the world exists"
"42) Finally, unlike the other authors in this volume Murphy does not seem to privilege domain experts or communities of70 ALEXANDER"
Perhaps that arises from the fact that Murphy was the only contributor tothe volume who did not focus discussion around scientificdomains where empirical evidence holds sway
"Thus, when Iconsider Murphy’s espoused views on conceptualization,sociocultural influences, and truth, I place her somewherebetween the cognitive constructivists and the socialconstructivist; that is toward the center of Figure 2"
"In summary, looking across the articles in this volume, I find that most can be justifiably cast as relatively soft or moremoderate with regard to their epistemological stances onconceptual change rather than hard or more extreme in theirviewpoints"
"That being said, the “soft” label seems more pre - cariously applied to Greeno and van de Sande’s perspectival understanding, especially when the dialogue moves awayfrom questions about the source of knowledge to where suchknowledge resides"
"Nonetheless, I hold that even Greeno andvan de Sande cannot operate theoretically without some ac - knowledgment of individual cognition even if it is to sub - sume that individual mind within a collective or distributed mentality"
"But what about conceptual ontology; that is, what does con- ceptual change actually mean to these individuals"
To whatdegree are those seeking to build bridges between cognitiveand sociocultural perspectives dealing with rather subtle oreveryday changes in individuals’ or groups’ conceptual un-derstanding
"Or, is their focus on more drastic and hard toachieve transformations in conceptualization"
The questionof the nature of conceptual change has significance becauseit is my contention that it is easier to ford the theoreticalriver when the waters are rather shallow and calm versuswhen they are deep and turbulent
"In other words, if cogni - tive or sociocultural researchers restrict their conversations to quieter and less dramatic forms of conceptual change,such as occurs through accretion or even assimilation(weak restructuring), there may be less grounds for conflictthan when they venture into more contested terrain such asthat aligned with accommodation, especially radical re - structuring"
Here again the contrast between the perspectives of Greeno and van de Sande andV osniadou proves enlighten - ing
"As they did in addressing issues of epistemology, Greeno and van de Sande appear to have stayed within safer andmore charted waters"
"That is to say, while their article is re - plete with cases of conceptual growth, none of their cases ex - pressly manifest more radical forms of conceptual change or expressly address the contentious question of transfer thathas riled the waters for cognitivists and socioculturalists inthe past (Alexander & Murphy, 1999; Greeno, Smith, &Moore, 1996)"
"For instance, Greeno and van de Sande offerone case representing individuals’ quiet assimilation into a community of practice"
"…a group such as a classroom changes so that more of its stu - dent members participate productively in its discourse in - volving a concept or conception, that change counts as a form of conceptual growth by the classroom community as well asby those individuals whose productive participation regard - ing that concept or conception increased"
"12) They also describe a more involved situation from the re - search of Stenning, Greeno, Hall, Sommerfeld, and Wiebe (2002) showing that students who constructed models of population growth and decline developed understanding of predation that enabledthem to include it as a factor in a complex model in support ofa proposal to solve a hypothetical problem involving predatorand prey populations"
"13) Although both instances support their arguments relative to perspectival understanding, they do not address the potentialfor significant epistemological or ontological shifts on thepart of the group or its members"
"By comparison,V osniadou dives headlong into the con- troversial area of knowledge transfer, even while givingground to the role of social influences and contextual factorsin the change process"
"Moreover, the process of formulatingmental models she describes as part of framework theory em-braces both the subtle and more dramatic aspects of thechange process"
"For instance, she describes simple, bot-tom-up, additive mechanisms akin to accretion as “capable ofproducing spontaneous developmental conceptual changes,assuming that new knowledge is coming in through observa - tion and/or from the culture” (p"
"Eventually, the accumu - lation of those experiences may result in whatV osniadou la - bels as “branch jumping…or as an ontological shift…and represents a considerable re-organization of the concept ofliving thing” (p"
"Unlike Greeno and van de Sande,V osniadou is not con - tent to stay within the realm of everyday experiences"
"In - stead, she holds that such everyday encounters can lead to misleading synthetic models that demand more direct andsignificant interventions"
"Consequently,V osniadou arguesthat “to explain conceptual change, we should allow for thepossibility that what is already known can be radically re - structured and that new, qualitative different structures emerge” (p"
"LikeV osniadou’s framework theory, Murphy’s model of knowledge/belief change encompasses levels of changeranging from subtle accretion to more radical transforma - tions"
"Specifically, it would appear that restructuring, espe - cially the radical form, would be possible for those reaching the stage of explanatory power and essential for those who at - tain examined understanding within any conceptual domain.COGNITION AND SOCIOCULTURALISM 71"
