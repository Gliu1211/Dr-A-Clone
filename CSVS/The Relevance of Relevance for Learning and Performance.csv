"relevance, be introduced to many of its forms and manifestations, recognize how it is linked to diverse literatures and where it is situated within varying theoretical orientations"
Readers of this issue will alsobe informed about novel and alternative procedures for the statistical analysis of relevance data
"However, does this wealth of psychological content achieve the dual goals of greater clarity and enhanced understanding sought by the editors"
"Or —as often happens when an idea that has long pop- ulated educational, psychological, and philosophical literatures, as well as everyday discourse, is castinto the limelight —does the effort create even more ambiguity or give rise to even more questions"
"As someone privileged to critically re ﬂect on the thought-provoking articles included in this issue, I expe- rienced both reactions"
"On the one hand, there were undoubtedly moments of clarity about relevance, especially in terms of its place within motivation theory and social psychology research"
I garnereddeeper and richer understandings about how respected motivation and social psychology researchersdeﬁned and modeled relevance and how they set out to change or measure it
"On the other hand, I came away with the sense that certain assumptions upon which this work was predicated meritedreconsideration and that critical pieces to the relevance puzzle still needed to be put in place"
"Thus, Iwill use this commentary as an opportunity for critical re ﬂection on areas of agreement about relevance that emerge across the diverse perspectives represented in this issue"
I will then share certain confusions that remained for me about the nature and nurturing of relevance and the role it plays in educational practice
"In effect, I will use the platform of this commentary to consider the relevance ofrelevance for the learning and performance"
"Consilience In devising this special issue, Albrecht and Karabenick (this issue) were intentional in their efforts to assemble researchers who hold to varied theoretical orientations toward learning and motivation in general and, consequently, toward relevance in particular"
"Thus, Acee, Weinstein, Hoang, and Flaggs (this issue) draw on a history of research in learning strategies and self-regulation to frame their article on value reappraisal that entails prompting learners to rethink their perspectives on tasks with the endgoal of improved academic outcomes"
"Priniski, Hecht, and Harackiewicz (this issue), whose research is nested within social and personality psychology, craft a model of personal relevance that progresses ona continuum from personal association to personal usefulness and, ultimately, to identi ﬁcation"
(this issue) understand- ably view relevance through the lens of autonomously motivated learning and consider self-relevance from the viewpoint of learners ’volition
"For Walkington and Bernacki (this issue), with combined expertise in mathematics and intelligent tutoring systems, the focus is on context personalization orthe use of adaptive systems that allow for curricular modi ﬁcations meant to forge connections between a student and mathematics problem solving"
(this issue) offer a procedure for considering students ’compliance or noncompliance with a given intervention as a mechanism for judging the effects of that intervention
The compliers average causaleffects (CACE) and noncompliers average causal effects (NCACE) procedures afford a metric for considering ﬁdelity of treatment at the individual level and for assessing the effects of that treatment when participants ’compliance or noncompliance is taken into account
"For this issue, this technique was applied to data from a large-scale relevance intervention (Gaspard, Dicke, et al., 2015)"
"As with Nagengast and colleagues (this issue), Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue) apply a more novel data-analytic technique to relevance-speci ﬁc data"
"Also, in a rather unique way, Hartwell and Kaplan started from a more phenomenological orientation"
"Speci ﬁcally, these authors ﬁrst sought to unearth students ’perceptions of relevance, as revealed in the ninth-graders ’responses to prompts about any associations they could envision between a given task and their life experiences"
"The MDS resulted in a two-dimen- sional mapping with the ﬁrst dimension, relevance degree, being interpreted as the extent of perceived self-relevance, and the second dimension, cognitive-value, distinguishing between value-related andcognitive aspects of relevance conceptions.THE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION 125"
"Given this conceptual range and the contrasting perspectives, is consilience possible for these con- tributing authors when it comes to relevance"
Consilience is a term introduced by Whewell (1840) and used by Wilson (1998) to describe unity of knowledge across varied disciplines
I began this commen- tary by asking whether there was any unity of knowledge surrounding relevance that could be extractedfrom these six contributions
"In re ﬂecting on these articles, I found that there was indeed common ground to be mapped"
"In several cases, that common ground was expressly identi ﬁed by authors, whereas in other cases that common ground came in the form of tacit assumptions guiding the collec-tive work"
"Speci ﬁcally, the explicit common ground shared by these authors ’views the construct of relevance as person centered, complex or multifaceted, signi ﬁcant, and modi ﬁable"
"Perhaps even more intriguing to me, as someone engag ed in critical analysis of this special issue, were the largely unvoiced assumptions about relevance as it is presumed to function within the context oflearning and performance"
"I refer to these assumptions as largely unvoiced because they were often located“between the cracks ”of the discourse, marked as much by what was not mentioned by authors as what they explicitly stated"
It was this tacit area of consilience that fueled certain puzzlements about the natureand nurturing of relevance and its place within educational practice
"For now, let me return to the common ground shared by contributors to this issue"
"Relevance as person centered In their introductory article, Albrecht and Karabenick (this issue) use the enticing claim posed by phi- losopher Israel Schef ﬂer (1969) to capture a central theme of this special issue: “Nothing is either rele- vant or irrelevant in and of itself"
"To Schef ﬂer’s three interrogatives, I would add another of importance to the ensuing treatises, “Who"
"” For the contributors to this issue of the Journal of Experimental Education, there appears to be an unwavering emphasis on the individual and on relevance as seen through the eyes of the “one.” Although there is mention of others within the pages of this issue, including teachers, the commonground among these works is that they remain ﬁxed on the individual student —the self —in the perspectives they hold and the models they propose"
(this issue) cast value reappraisal as a general strategy that could be applied broadly to academic content or tasks to stimulate reassessments of domain or task value or utility.These reappraisals seek relevance adjustments that are speci ﬁc to individual students
(this volume) conceptualizes the movement from personalassociation to identi ﬁcation as a uniquely individual experience
"In articulating their identity-based model of relevance, Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue) are very evidently focused on the one in that they “intentionally foreground the role of the self and self-related exploration in relevance construction"
"” Relatedly, the plethora of terms that populate this co llection of articles have a distinctively person-spe- ciﬁcf oc us"
"Self-relevance, for example, is discussed both by Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue) and by Van- steenkiste et al"
"Speci ﬁcally, Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue) conceptualize self-relevance in terms of “meaningful personal connections ”that a student may seek to forge with academic content"
(this issue) likewise speak of self-relevance as the personal meaning a student brings to a learning task
’s(this issue) conceptualization carries the same conno- tation of a “personally meaningful connection ”(p
"Despite the absence of “self”or “personal ”as an identi ﬁer, Walkington and Bernacki (this issue) offer an explicit de ﬁ nition of relevance pertinent to personalized learning or PL that also connotes a student-centered emphasis"
"What varies isthat these authors move away from the idea of meaningfulness to “objects, events, goals, and ideas that a learner ﬁnds familiar, likes, or values, combining cogn itive, affective, and motivational components ”(p"
Relevance as complex and multifaceted Yet another area of agreement that emerges from the authors ’varied treatises is the implication that simplistic or unidimensional perspectives of relevance that might suf ﬁce as folk constructs are wholly126P
inadequate when the construct moves from everyday discourse to formal theories and models
"In every instance, these researchers have conveyed a conceptualization of relevance that is complex and multi-faceted or multidimensional in nature"
"In some ways, the Hartwell and Kaplan article (this issue) bridges folk and formal conceptions of relevance in that it starts with the language of students andbuilds to a more formal depiction of self-relevance"
"That is, the multidimensional portrayal of self-relevance begins with the responses of ninth graders to open questions that asked them to discuss howcertain biology topics were personally meaningful to them"
"By engaging in detailed analysis of thoseresponses via multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, the authors provide support for their conten- tion that students ’conceptions of self-relevance encompass three key dimensions: the academic con- tent, the student ’s identity, and the connection students build between those two"
(this issue) offer a model of ration- ales that should “foster perceived self-relevance and promote the process of internalization ”for students (this issue)
"From their analysis, the authors conclude that contextual, task-related, andlearner-related factors must be simultaneously considered when trying to formulate a rationale thatwill be seen as self-referential and that is apt to foster internalization"
"In these components, there is anoticeable relation to the three dimensions described by Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue), who also acknowledge the role of context, a dimension central to Vansteenkiste et al"
"do not speci ﬁcally write in terms of the multidimensionality of relevance, they provide suf ﬁcient evidence that it is not easy to alter the negative perceptions that students come to hold about speci ﬁc academic domains or tasks"
"In effect, the process model they have described to evoke reappraisals of task value judgments entails activities to elicit immediate cognitive-affectiveresponses regarding coursework that are regarded as critical to changes in perceptions about therelevance of what is being taught and what is being tasked in academic courses"
"Relevance as important Motivation has been broadly de ﬁned as the physiological processes involved in the direction, vigor, and persistence of behavior (Bergin, Ford, & Hess, 1993,p"
"For many educational psychologists, con- cern for motivation revolves around academic achievement or the direction, vigor, and persistence ofbehaviors that contribute to students ’success relative to whatever internal or external standards have been set for educational performance (Alexander & Murphy, 1998 ; Alexander & Riconscente, 2005)"
Relevance for these researchers is perceived as a mechanism to elicit the vigor or persistence seen as necessary to achieve those standards
"For social psychologists, the importance of relevance rests in thedegree to which it moves individuals away from a strong extrinsic motivation for performance inacademic contexts to one that is increasingly more intrinsic in nature"
"In this way, relevance enhancesthe likelihood that students ’actions will be driven by their will or volition (Ryan & Deci, 2000)"
"Still for others, relevance carries a personal identi ﬁcation with the content or tasks that are far more likely to invigorate students ’engagement or promote persistence (Rosenzweig & Wig ﬁeld,2016)"
"When students identify in some positive manner with a domain of study or regard themselves as “good ”at some academic task, then there is a degree of relevance that that domain or task holds for them"
"For all these perspectives, however, relevance serves as a means to a valued end"
Its importance comes from what it instigates rather than what it inherently represents
"Moreover, what the attentionto relevance often affords in the studies cited by contributors are documented changes in attitudestoward target content or tasks, more evidence of regulatory behaviors, or higher reports of interest inthe domain"
"For instance, if a science teacher in high school or a professor of statistics utilizes a value-reappraisal strategy, it may increase student engagement in the academic experiences presented to thestudents"
"Or if students are given some choice in the problems they solve or ﬁnd the events depicted in a problem to re ﬂect their lives, they may well attend more to the content, identify some solution path suggested by their prior experiences, or simply persist longer"
"Of course, whether any of these steps ultimately translate into signi ﬁcant gains in learning or achievement or endure for any period following the intervention is less well established"
"side, Walkington and Bernacki (this issue) discuss how attempts to ground arithmetic or algebra prob- lems in students ’everyday experiences and language have resulted in better problem solving in certain investigations (e.g., Koedinger, Alibali, & Nathan, 2008)"
"However, as they acknowledge, a clear direct causal path between relevance interventions like their personalized learning environments and studentlearning outcomes has yet to be forged in the empirical literature"
"In fact, as the work of Harackiewiczand colleagues (Canning & Harackiewicz, 2015) and others (Rosenzweig & Wig ﬁeld,2016) suggests, relevance interventions are not often globally effective and may even prove detrimental to some stu-dents"
"Thus, what becomes important is to understand better when such interventions are warranted, for whom, and under what conditions"
"Relevance as modi ﬁable One of the strongest points of consilience for th ec on tr ibu tor st oth i sis su e,e ve ni fi tw a snot expressly stated by some, is the sha red belief that relevance is not ﬁxed for any learner"
"Instead, what content or tasks individuals perceive as personally meaningful, of interest, valuable, useful,or that to which they can identify is expected to shift as conditions internal and external tothat individual change"
"For example, in articula ting the process of personalization, Walkington and Bernacki (this issue) describe contextualg rounding and funds of knowledge as two critical features in designing systems for personalized instruction"
"Contextual grounding, an externaldimension, pertains to everyday situations rele vant to students to which instruction and assess- ment ends should be linked"
"In contrast, funds of knowledge, which describes the various resources that students have derived from being me mbers of various social/cultural communi- ties, is an internal dimension that must be addressed when orchestrating personalized learningenvironments"
"It is also apparent from the number of interventions described or referenced within these articles, that these researchers hold that it is not only possible but also desirable to orchestrate conditions thatpromote positive judgments of meaningfulness, interest, value, or utility of academic content and tasks.In fact, outside the critical analysis by Priniski et al"
"(this issue) there was little explicit discussion by these researchers that their speci ﬁc orchestrated experiences may prove nonoptimal for particular learners, particular content, or particular contexts"
"Indeed, this lack of detail pertaining to which inter- ventions should be expected to translate into what cognitive or affective outcomes for whom is what led Priniski et al"
(this issue) to identify this concern as a direction for future research
"As these researchers write: “Thus the same UV intervention could increase perceptions of personal association, usefulness, or identi ﬁcation for different students"
This type of treatment heterogeneity can be a great asset for an intervention that needs to reach a diverse group of students with different levels of initialinterest or success expectancies ”(p
"Puzzlements For all the points of clari ﬁcation and new insights about relevance that these special issue authors have contributed, there were nonetheless puzzlements that arose for me"
"As mentioned, those puzzlements resulted from assumptions about relevance that were more or less taken as givens by the contributors"
"Yet, from my theoretical perspective as a cognitive contextualist concerned with the nature and processof learning unfolding in schools and in the world outside of school, those “givens ”demand critical examination (Alexander, Schallert, & Reynolds, 2009)"
It is my sense that delving into those tacit assumptions will bring greater clarity to the construct of relevance and inform future efforts to craftinterventions that lead not only to desired attitudinal or regulatory changes but also to improvedlearning and performance
"Speci ﬁcally, what I extracted from these six contributions are ﬁve shared assumptions about the nature and promotion of relevance"
Those assumptions that call for critical analysis are: /C15What is taught or what is tasked in schools has relevance that simply awaits identi ﬁcation
"/C15When relevance with content and tasks is forged, improved learning or performance will eventu- ally be realized.128P"
/C15The identi ﬁcation of relevance requires the learner (the who) to forge a personal association with what is being taught or tasked (the what)
"/C15There are ways to increase the possibility that learners will recognize the meaningfulness, value, or utility of what is being taught and what is being tasked"
/C15Relevance is a construct of signi ﬁcance for all learners and all academic content and tasks
"Inherent relevance What struck me about these treatises in general was that the contributors seemed to accept the idea that there is, in fact, relevance to be found in the “whats ”of schooling —the content and assignments that students in elementary, secondary, or tertiary education encounter"
"Thus, the task for students ismerely to unearth that meaningfulness, to recognize the utility of that content, or to become intrinsi-cally motivated by the assignments given"
"Is every topic, every lesson, and every task that students encounter valuable, signi ﬁcant, or personally interesting"
"Having spent a good many years as a public school teacher and then as a university professor, Ihave perused numerous curricula, observed countless lessons, scanned many a school textbook, andevaluated an array of assignments and assessments"
"Throughout those experiences, I often felt uncer-tain of the merits of what was being taught, tasked, or tested"
"It was unclear to me why topicX waschosen as the focus of a lesson or assignment rather than Y, and I rarely heard teachers describe orillustrate the importance of what was being taught, tasked, or tested"
"It has long been my mantra that educators at all levels are teaching less and less about more and more (Alexander, 2017;A lex a nde r,M ur ph y,&Wo od s, 1996)"
"Further, it is sometimes a struggle to identify the principled knowledge that educators are seeking to promote in their students not only at the lesson or task level but also in terms of the academic do main or discipline of concern"
"I use the term principled knowledge to denote those concepts or procedures that are core to a domain and that are foundational to subsequent learning in that ﬁeld (Alexander et al., 1996; Gelman & Greeno, 1989)"
"When students and teachers grasp those principles, they can see them re ﬂected in the content and are more likely to recog- nize the value or utility of a speci ﬁc lesson or task meant to build on those principles"
"Moreover, teachers are better prepared to illuminate that val ue or utility to their students during the ﬂow of instruction"
"In reality, however, the mile-wide-and-inch-deep cu rriculum is well established in the educational sys- tem (Schmidt, Houang, & Cogan, 2011)"
"Lessons are crammed with questi onable information, the signi ﬁ- cance of which is rarely re ﬂected upon"
My purpose in raising this dep ressing thought is that efforts to interject relevance into learning and instructions hould consider a more systemic approach
"Even as edu- cators and educational researchers labor to help students ﬁnd some personal value or utility in what is being taught, tasked, or tested, there should be con comitant efforts to reframe and reform what is being taught, tasked, and tested"
These reforms efforts will undoubtedly require supports for teachers as they work to identify the principled domain and topic kno wledge that warrants instructional time and as they consider ways to communicate the signi ﬁcance and relevance of that content to their students
"That is to say, even as researchers devise student-level interventions intended to instigate relevance judgments, it would seem imperative that educators and curriculum developers at all levels of schoolstake a long and hard look at what they are teaching"
There should be a concerted effort to de ﬁne the principled knowledge that warrants time and attention in academic domains and to ensure that stu-dents both understand the signi ﬁcance of that content and have ample opportunity to learn it
"Thus, the practice of teaching less and less about more and more should be abandoned"
"Instead, the practiceshould be to teach more about less, with the less comprising concepts and procedures of signi ﬁcance — a signi ﬁcance that can be communicated meaningfully to students"
Improved learning/performance Yet another assumption that appears to guide the work of the contributing authors is that students ’rec- ognition of relevance will ultimately result in improved learning or enhanced performance
I take noissue with the assumption that learners who perceive the value or importance of academic content andTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION 129
"tasks or who ﬁnd themselves personally interested in what is taught or tasked should generally outper- form those who regard such content or tasks as meaningless, trivial, or mundane"
"The problem is thatthe path from relevance to improved learning or enhanced performance is by no means direct, as sug-gested by the models described in this issue (e.g., Acee et al., this issue ; Vansteenkiste et al., this issue)"
"Rather, the contributors seem to envision relevance as instigating changes in students ’attitudes toward the content or tasks, which in turn evokes changes in their behaviors, which should ultimately contrib-ute to positive academic outcomes"
"For example, that indirect path to learning or performance outcomes is seen in the process model offered by Vansteenkiste et al"
"In their model, rationale-related features contribute to per- ceptions of self-relevance on the learner ’s part and to the process of internalization central to SDT"
"Subsequently, when these changes of perception and internalization are realized, learners are expectedto manifest not only increased engagement and a greater sense of well-being but also improved learn-ing and performance"
"Similarly, the value-reappraisal intervention devised by Acee and Weinstein(2010) and referenced in several of the articles in this issue was found to prompt shifts in the values students placed on the learning of statistics and on their views of the utility of statistics for accomplish-ing future goals"
"However, even as they reported on the bene ﬁts of this intervention, Acee and Weinstein acknowledged that there was only “tentative evidence ”that the intervention “could increase students ’performance on course exams but these bene ﬁts seemed to depend on unknown instructor and course factors ”(p"
"Indeed, tentative evidence of the effects of relevance on learning and performance was what gener- ally characterized the articles populating this issue or referenced by the contributing authors"
Whatwas more evident was that efforts to help students see the value or utility of what is being taught ortasked is more likely to translate into self-reported changes in attitudes or an expressed willingness tobe more strategically engaged
The lingering question that must then be asked is whether such self- reported changes in attitudes or perceptions in the short term translate into documented changes in students ’learning behaviors over the long term
"Even more importantly, it is important to ask what the true value or utility of efforts to transform students ’perceptions of personal relevance amounts to if there is no empirical evidence that their learning and performance is positively impacted"
"Thus, asthe theoretical and empirical work on relevance progresses, I would expect to see more attention paidto the immediate and long-term effects on students ’learning or academic performance"
"Learner responsibility Given the contributors ’orientations toward relevance as a motivational construct, their emphases on individual learners and the personal or intrinsic association they perceive between themselves and theobjects or “whats ”of instruction seem justi ﬁably placed"
"Within the context of school-based learning and instruction, however, there is yet another dimension to relevance that warrants consideration — rooted relevance (Alexander et al., 1996)"
"Before I de ﬁne this term, let me provide a bit of context for its generation"
"For some time, I had been wrestling with the question of why so many educational inno-vations fail and why there is the tendency among educators and policymakers to revisit some iteration of failed techniques over and over (Alexander & Knight, 1993)"
"Moreover, through our research, my colleagues and I (Alexander, Murphy, & Woods, 1997) became aware of a lack of foundational domain and disciplinary knowledge among educators responsible forteaching others"
"Thus, we came to see that lack of domain or disciplinary knowledge as one of thebarriers to effective school reform (Alexander et al., 1996)"
We concluded that particular treatise by forwarding several recommendations we felt would help to break this unhealthy cycle and contributeto more effective instruction
I have already introduced you to two of those recommendations: Seekprincipled knowledge and teach more about less
Still another of those recommendations speaks directly to this special issue on relevance —rooted relevance
"In generating the term rooted relevance, my co-authors and I sought to convey that educators hold a dual responsibility in what they teach, task, or test (Alexander et al., 1996)"
"On the one hand, they should be suf ﬁciently rooted in (i.e., knowledgeable about) the domains and disciplines they teach so130P"
"they can represent those domains and disciplines substantively, accurately, and meaningfully to their students"
"On the other hand, educators must know their students well enough to understand how thosedomains and disciplines naturally relate to learners ’individual goals, interests, and experiences"
"What we wanted to make evident was that, neither rootedness nor relevancy alone will break the unendingcycle of innovation/condemnation/innovation that has been established in educational research andpractice"
"What seems requisite is a relevance to real-world, contemporary problems that is also wellrooted in the histories and theories upon which they are based"
"39) Consequently, just as there needs to be a more systematic approach to relevance within the educa- tional system, teachers have a signi ﬁcant and mediating role to play"
"Educators at all levels need to con- sider how what they teach, task, or test is meaningful to the domain under study, while simultaneouslycommunicating the personal value or meaning that content holds for the students"
"Augmented relevance As a devotee of John Dewey, it is always pleasing to see his writings acknowledged when someone is trying to unravel the complexities of psycho logical constructs like relevance"
"Yet, there was a bit of irony for me in the contributors ’referencing of Dewey when I consider the speci ﬁc approaches to forging relevance they overview and the populations that were of primary con cern to them"
"As with the editors of this special issue, I see the shadow of Dew ey looming large when the idea of relevance is framed as that which is personally meaningful or interesting"
One insight I drew from Dewey (1913) pertained tom i sgu ide def fort so fs om eed uc a tor st om ak ewh a ti st a ught “interesting ”to students
"As he wrote: Here, and here only, have we the reality of the idea of “making things interesting"
"”I know of no more demoraliz- ing doctrine —when taken literally —than the assertion of some of the opponents of interest that after subject-mat- ter has been selected, then the teacher should make it interesting"
"On one side, it makes the selection of subject-matter a matter quite independent of the question of inter- est—that is to say of the child ’s native urgencies and needs; and, further, it reduces method in instruction to more or less external and arti ﬁcial devices for dressing up the unrelated materials, so that they will get some hold upon attention"
"23) Dewey goes on to explain how meaningfulness or personal interest is better manifest within school- ing—an explanation that echoes what my co-authors and I (Alexander et al., 1996) tried to capture in our notion of rooted relevance"
"In reality, the principle of “making things interesting ”means that subjects be selected in relation to the child ’s present experience, powers, and needs and that (in case he does not perceive or appreciate this relevancy) the newmaterial be presented in such a way as to enable the child to appreciate its bearings, its relationships, its value in connection with what already has signi ﬁcance for him"
"23 –24) I invoke Dewey (1913) here due to concerns that arose from how contributors to this issue described interventions meant to help learners recognize the va lue, utility, or meaningfulness within what is being taught and tasked"
"My concerns rest not so much on what these experts say, but rather what was not said about enhancing perceptions of relevance"
"Fr om my vantage point, the interventions were wholly aimed at learners and their efforts to ﬁnd something of value, utility, or meaningfulness in the content and assignments given them"
There was little said about the responsibilities of teachers in this endeavor
"For Dewey, the role of the teacher in illuminating relevance is made apparent, and the onus for ﬁnding personal meaningfulness is no longer conveyed as the sole or primary responsibility of the students"
"I appreciate that several contributors mentioned educators ’explication of the value or utility of what they were teaching or assigning to students (Vansteenkiste et al., this issue)"
"However, I would caution that merely “mentioning ”the value or utility of what is taught or tasked may have limited effect"
"As with Walkington and Bernacki (this issue), I would be leery of rather shallow attempts to personalize academic content"
"If there are bene ﬁts to be accrued from more super- ﬁcial or “seductive ”approaches to personalization, those bene ﬁts would likely be short lived"
"Rather, to echo Dewey ’s(1913) words, the content should be presented in such a way that students can “appreci- ate its bearings, its relationships, its value ”(p"
"I must admit that as I was writing the section, I could hear the voice of my late friend, Claire Ellen Weinstein, echoing in my head"
"She would remind me that students must ﬁnd a way to help themselves in those situations where teachers are not even mentioning the value, utility, or meaningfulness of thecontent, much less illuminating that relevance for students"
"Nonetheless, asmotivation and strategy researchers attempt to inform the education communities about the power ofrelevance, they should aim for interventions that get to the heart of relevance rather than those thatmight rest on tenuous grounds"
"There should be attempts to create comprehensive interventions thatmake teachers, students, and the educational system partners in this enterprise"
"Such interventions would not place the responsibility of discovering relevance solely on the back of students who, as novi- ces, may be poorly positioned to see the value, utility, or meaningfulness of what is taught or tasked inthe way more knowledgeable others can and should"
Learner and domain characteristics I would assume that those contributing to this issue would agree that relevance is a construct of signi ﬁ- cance to all learners and all ﬁelds of study
Relevance is not the dominion of any speci ﬁc age group or academic domain
"Even if these authors do not expres sly state this fact, their conceptions, models, and interventions are not explicitly con ﬁne dt op art ic ul a ra ge so rd om a ins.Th a tbe in gs a i d,Iw a saw ar eth at there was a strong emphasis within these articles on students in middle school through college"
Therewas also more attention paid to the areas of science and mathematics over other content domains
"For example, in their methodological piece, Hartwell and Kaplan (this issue) use the written responses of ninth-grade students to questions about the relevance of particular biology topics to theirlives as the source for their MDS analysis of relevance"
"(this issue) conduct a secondary analysis of data gathered from an intervention project by Gaspard, Dicke, et al"
"In their development of personalized learning tech- nologies, Walkington and Bernacki (this issue) also targeted mathematics and used students at thesixth- to eighth-grade levels to support their claims"
"(this issue) mention perti- nent research at the middle school level, much of what they detail involves high school and college stu-dents"
They likewise build their case for utility-value (UV) interventions around science andmathematics content
(this issue) describe grew out of the challenges that college students faced in ﬁnding relevance in their statistics courses
"With this clear pattern identi ﬁed, I was left to re ﬂect on why those promoting the relevance of rele- vance had bounded their articles in this manner"
"Were there compelling reasons to situate relevance in middle school, high school, or college or to concentrate on the domains of science and mathematics?Upon re ﬂection, I was able to formulate several plausible reasons for this pattern: research facility, empirical traditions, and academic needs"
"Research facility In much of what Dewey (1897,1913) writes on interest, he focuses on young children and the organic nature of the interests they manifest"
There is often little need to help the young ﬁnd interest in educa- tional experiences
"They may know what inter-ests them, but they may have little understanding as to why"
They also have limited capacity to sharetheir thinking orally or in writing
"Because of such challenges in studying relevance in the young, itmakes sense that researchers more often focus on older children, adolescents, and adults who are betterable to re ﬂect on and articulate their views about the value, utility, or meaningfulness of what they are being taught or what they are tasked with"
"Moreover, because relevance as described in this special issue involves an association between a learner and some domain of study or associated task, it helps that older children through adults have amore-developed sense of academic domains"
"In effect, their notions of science and mathematics, biologyor statistics have suf ﬁcient maturity to allow them to re ﬂect upon and respond to questions about the132P"
"From the standpoint of facility, there- fore, there is justi ﬁcation for the contributing authors ’emphasis on older rather than younger students"
Empirical traditions There is another plausible reason for the learner and domain emphases observed in this issue
"Motiva- tion and development researchers, who are well represented among contributing authors, have a longtradition of studying that point in students ’academic development where there is a noticeable decline in their personal investment in schooling (e.g., Anderman & Maehr, 1994, Eccles et al., 1993)"
"In justifying their focus onmathematics, for example, Walkington and Bernacki (this issue) argued that: “Mathematics is a natural area to apply ideas of relevance, as students ’interest in learning mathematics tends to decline over adolescence ”(p"
"Consequently, it makes sense that these researchers would carry forward those research traditions, as they explore more novel constructs such as relevance"
"Academic needs Finally, it is conceivable that the contributions in this special issue converge on the domains on mathe- matics and science because these are perceived as a reas of particular need now and in the years to come (Ellis, 2008)"
"It is dif ﬁcult to pick up any educational publication that does not reference STEM ﬁelds and students ’declining pursuit or competence in those ﬁelds as a cause for concern (Wang, 2013)"
"That concern is greater for underrepresented populations who may regard the content of science and mathe-matics as abstract in form and removed from their eve ryday existences (Harackiewicz, Canning, Tibbetts, Priniski, & Hyde, 2016)"
That is why the search for personal meaning or relevance when it comes to sci- ence and mathematics may compel the contributing authors investment in these domains
"Regardless of the justi ﬁcations for centering on older students and on science and mathematics, it is imperative that those who see relevance as a relevant motivation construct expand their investigationto match the theoretical and philosophical foundations from which that construct arises"
"While it issensible to start with those grades and domains wherein the ability to empirically investigate relevanceis perhaps easier and the demonstrated need is stronger, there is much more to be uncovered aboutthis construct"
"For instance, there is little understanding of how the seeds of interest that Deweydescribes among the young take root over the course of the educational experience"
What con ﬁguration of internal and external factors stimulates the development of certain realms of meaningfulness while others remain stunted or wither away
