SENTENCES
"Engagement and literacy: reading between the lines As the designated commentator for the Special Issue, I have the distinct pleasure of im- mersing myself in the writings of international scholars sharing their insights on the topicof literacy engagement"
"For this commentary, I have made it my purpose to uncover the common ground occupied by the contributing authors"
"This common ground largely takes the form of shared perceptions of literacy engagement, engaged readers and writers and lit-eracy environments conducive to engagement"
"For that reason, I have cast these shared per- ceptions as guiding principles that can inform future research and instructional practice"
"Although these guiding principles are echoed in each article, their manifestations vary tosome extent as a result of the authors ’purposes, methodologies and the data upon which they rely"
"When warranted, I have taken note of particular variations that help to exemplify these guiding principles"
"Yet, what I regard as my foremost obligation as a commentator is to reveal the story of literacy engagement that cannot be found in the speci ﬁc words or phrases these authors put to paper"
"This is the story of engagement and literacy that exists between the lines , in what is not said or in the questions not asked"
"I, by no means, wish to imply anything nefarious on the authors ’part in this regard"
"Quite to the contrary, this is a natural and unavoidable occurrence in writing, especially in the case of the well-organised and cohesive collectionof articles that this Special Issue represents"
"You see, whenever authors highlight speci ﬁc ideas and practices about a construct, like literacy engagement, they inevitably cast shadows over other ideas and practices"
"As the commentator to this issue, I have the luxuryof exploring those unlit spaces, and the lingering questions they engender"
"It is my hope that these lingering questions, combined with the insights offered by the thoughtful and in- formative articles that comprise this issue, will provoke thought or spark inquiry"
"Guiding principles As the coeditors of this Special Issue describe in their opening editorial, the contributing authors were expressly chosen with a vision of what this compilation would accomplish.This overarching vision perhaps explains the alignment of these individual articles around certain fundamental principles about engagement and about engaged readers and writers"
"Here, I summarise those principles and brie ﬂy describe how they manifest in individual articles"
"Engagement is a multidimensional construct that can manifest behaviourally, cognitively, emotionally or socially"
"Within this Special Issue, there is concurrence around the idea that engagement is not a single, uni ﬁed construct, but rather a complex of behaviours, thoughts, feelings and social interactions that signify an individual ’s willingness to be an actor in his or her own learn- ing"
"This encompassing view means that there are various paths that students may pursue when seeking to be engaged in literacy learning and development, just as there are differentapproaches that educators and educational researchers can enact to foster students ’engage- ment or to gauge its manifestation in students"
"Although engagement is conceptualised as multidimensional, its operationalisation is typically more constrained"
"For instance, it canbe presumed that the behavioural markers of engagement, which are by nature more overt and directly observable, are what frequently gets acknowledged in instructional practiceENGAGEMENT AND LITERACY: READING BETWEEN THE LINES 733 © 2018 UKLA"
The other dimensions of engagement must often be in- ferred from what is seen or heard or self-reported
"Indeed, self-reports of students ’or teachers ’cognitive processes, beliefs, motivations and emotions are common data sources for researchers, including those contributing to this Special Issue"
"For example, in their secondary analysis of PISA2009 data, Ho and Lau (2018) used three indices to capture reading engagement: reading enjoyment, reading diversity and on- line reading"
All three of these indices were based on self-report items from the PISA da-tabase
"Rosenzweig, Wig ﬁeld, Gaspard, and Guthrie (2018) focused on behavioural engagement in her examination of motivation-enhancing practices within classrooms"
"The measure of behavioural engagement in this study again took the form of self-report.One unique orientation to representing engagement in this Special Issue was found in the work of Ng, (2018, this issue), who approached engagement as a social act embedded in a speci ﬁc literacy context"
"Ng sought evidence of change in “the manner in which the teacher responded to the concerns voiced by the students regarding their silent reading ”, which represents the use of behavioural data to illuminate social engagement"
"Thus, even within this Special Issue with the diversity of data sources, it was interesting to note that there remained a reliance on the words spoken or written by students and teachers as part of school experiences, or the views they expressed on the array of self-re- port measures they completed"
"Thus, it would seem that the broad, multidimensional char-acter of literacy engagement to which the contributing authors ascribe was constrained by the methods of data collection that would not allow for the students ’or teachers ’beliefs, thinking, motivations and emotions to be directly accessed"
Engagement in the context of literacy is understood as students ’intentional in- volvement in processes and experiences that are facilitative to their develop- ment as readers and writers
"In the opening sentence of their editorial introducing this Special Issue, Ng and Graham (this issue) unequivocally state that literacy engagement represents “students ’involvement in activities and processes that develop their knowledge, skills and attitudes for comprehending and composing a variety of texts in oral, print, visual and digital formats ” (p.615, this issue)"
"Onthe explicit side, Bräten, Brante, and Strømsø (2018) refer to engagement as “processes that indicate productive participation in learning activities ”(p.682, this issue) –ad eﬁnition that largely mirrors that offered by Ng and Graham (this issue)"
"On the implicit side, au-thors of the two articles involving secondary data analyses relied on the conceptualisations reﬂected in their data sources, which were largely complementary to the editors ’deﬁnition"
"(2018) referenced the de ﬁnition in the CORI framework of an engaged reader as a student “motivated, strategic, knowledgeable, and actively involved in reading ”(p.627, this issue)"
"Similarly, Ho and Lau (2018) reiterated the de ﬁnition of read- ing engagement from PISA2009 that equated to “the motivation to read ”(p.657, this issue)"
"For remaining articles, there was no explicit de ﬁnition of literacy engagement to which the authors ’ascribed"
"However, given that two of those articles were authored by the edi- tors for this Special Issue, we can assume that the conceptualisations they shared in theopening editorial would remain consistent in their individual contributions"
"Thus, it is fair to conclude that literacy engagement, as represented in this issue, is a wholly positive force in reading and writing development that is marked by students ’willing participation in pro- cesses, activities or experiences that promote literacy learning.734 ALEXANDER © 2018 UKLA"
"Those who are engaged readers and writers are held to have signi ﬁcant aca- demic, motivational, emotional and social advantages over those who are not willing participants in their own literacy development"
What was most striking to me in my review of these thought-provoking articles was the wholly positive view of literacy engagement and of engaged readers and writers being con- veyed
"Whether the authors were describing engagement at the level of student (Graham,Daley, Aitken, Harris, & Robinson, 2018), classroom (Rosenzweig, 2018), schools (Kennedy, 2018) or the nation (Ho & Lau, 2018), such a consistently positive portrayal is nothing short of ideal"
"Speci ﬁcally, engaged readers and writers were described as stra- tegic, motivated, socially active and knowledgeable (Graham et al., 2018; Ng & Graham, this issue)"
"They are also cast as self-ef ﬁcacious, better readers and writers, persistent, effortful and self-regulatory (Rosenzweig et al., 2018)"
"Moreover, we are told that theseengaged students come from homes with more educated parents, who are themselves engaged in literate practices and who are also ﬁnancially able to provide their children with resources such as reading materials that facilitate literacy development (Ho & Lau, 2018).So, it would almost appear that those labelled as engaged readers and writers are already academic primed to succeed, even when the immediate learning environment is not partic- ularly facilitative"
Students who are disadvantaged academically or economically or attend schools serving the economically disadvantaged populations often lack the personal or ﬁscal resources that enable literacy engagement
"If the picture these articles paint of engaged readers and writers is truly uplifting, then a far less encouraging portrayal emerges for those who do not merit that label"
"Those who are considered ‘disadvantaged ’, either due to identi ﬁed literacy or learning problems (Graham et al., 2018) or as a consequence of the socioeconomic conditions in which they reside (Kennedy, 2018), or simply due to their cultural-ethnic backgrounds, which are ill-matched to the instructional contexts in which they are situated (Ng, 2018), are to some degree theantithesis of the engaged reader or writer"
"That is, these academically or economically in- need students have been characterised as relatively non-strategic and unmotivated, as well as less self-ef ﬁcacious self-regulatory, and effortful in their performance"
"While there is no claim that these attributes can be erased by enhancing students ’engagement, it is the underlying assumption of this Special Issue that these disadvantaging conditions can be offset, at least in part, with greater focus on the enabling factors the authors have identi ﬁed"
"For example, increased attention to these students ’motivations for reading and writing, more attention to their interests within the literacy curriculum (Graham et al., 2018), a personally meaningful reason for them to read and write (Bräten et al., 2018), an instruc-tional program that recognises their sociocultural backgrounds and opportunities for frequent interactions with peers that involve reading and writing (Ng, 2018), can help to counter the unwanted consequences associated with academic or economic disadvantages"
"Lingering questions Despite the wealth of information and the underlying principles that this Special Issue af- fords, or perhaps because of them, there were questions about literacy engagement and about engaged readers and writers lingering within those in-between spaces"
These are questionsENGAGEMENT AND LITERACY: READING BETWEEN THE LINES 735 © 2018 UKLA
My goal is to use this commentary to put those ques- tions into the public discourse in hopes that others will provide the answers I seek or will un- dertake the empirical research or classroom studies that lead to their resolution
Is the general term ‘engagement ’or‘literacy engagement ’actually being used to describe a rather speci ﬁc form of willing participation
"The message conveyed within these articles is that engagement, and more precisely literacy engagement, is an expression of students ’volition or willingness to be mentally or physically active participants in experiences that support their literacy learning and development"
"What is not as transparent, however, is that those literacy acts are quiteinfrequently of students ’own choosing"
"Rather, these are tasks that students are directed to do within the context of school instruction"
"If there is choice, it may come in the form of certain freedoms students have within the task parameters such as the choiceof speci ﬁc book or article from a given reading list (Bräten et al., 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018), or selection of a particular writing topic (e.g"
"In effect, it falls to students to ﬁnd some glimmer of personal value in whatever they are being asked to read or write"
"At best, teachers may speak about the general utility of literacy tasks or experiences they assign in their classes"
"Consequently, if there is personal relevance or meaningfulness to these assigned literacytasks for the individual student, it will often be left to him or her to suss that out (Can- ning & Harackiewicz, 2015)"
"More likely, they will operate under the presumption that the literacy assignment is just another duty they must perform as part of their jobs asstudents"
"If this is, in fact, the conception of literacy engagement framing this Special Issue or the literature on engagement, then what do we call the form of engagement that re ﬂects very dif- ferent motivations, like what I am experiencing in writing this commentary"
"In effect, what do we call engagement directed toward a task that matches students ’interests and goals, that excites or pleases them, and for which they feel ef ﬁcacious"
"For instance, preparing this commentary may represent a challenge, but I perceive it as within my abilities to meet that challenge"
"The bene ﬁts I reap include increased knowledge about the topic literacy engage- ment, and self-satisfaction with meeting the challenge to the best of my abilities"
"Thankfully, individuals do not have to be of similar age (thank goodness) or background to experience some version of this mode of literacy engagement"
"I have, on occasion, witnessed it among my elementary, high school, college and graduate students, althoughin developmentally different ways"
"What I am questioning here is whether the singular term, literacy engagement, ﬁts all iterations that can emerge over students ’academic maturation, or if there are developmental distinctions and varied instructional responses that need tobe made in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of literacy engagement"
"(2018) suggested, there may be something akin to a developmental model that exists for literacy engagement, as he and colleagues (Graham, Gillespie, & McKeown, 2013) have de-scribed for writing competence"
"If that is so, then one size (or de ﬁnition) may not ﬁt all the iterations of literacy engagement that manifest at any time or over time"
To what degree are the dimensions of engagement truly separable and validly measurable when enacted in everyday practice
"Overall, I found the arguments for the multidimensional nature of literacy engagement forwarded in this Special Issue to be quite convincing"
"their research on students ’use of multiple documents as the bases for writing a letter to the editor on climate change, I could see why behavioural engagement was the target of their analysis"
"Yet, when I read between the lines, it seemed that efforts to deconstruct engagement into its constituentforms demand further interrogation on that grounds that any single behaviour identi ﬁed as ‘engagement ’is likely the externalisation of other engagement forms invisible to the naked eye"
"For example, assume a researcher was observing in a classroom and noted a second grader raising her hand to ask a question (behavioural)"
What that researcher could not see was the con ﬂuence of internal conditions that this simple behaviour encompassed
The researcher coding for behavioural engagement could not know that this young girl had been wrestling with the teacher ’s declaration that Jack was foolish to sell his family ’s cow for magic beans (cognitive)
"Nor could that researcher know that the very word ‘fool- ish’for believing in magic sparked an emotional response in that student (emotional), who is from a culture where the power of magic is accepted and valued (social)"
The cognitive dissonance and emotional reaction this young girl felt compelled her to overcome her typ-ically quiet demeanour and reticence to speak (disposition) in order to seek clari ﬁcation from her teacher (motivation)
"As this illustrative case suggests, there are inevitably students who may display few in- stances of the behavioural indicators of engagement in the classroom, but whose level of internal engagement remains high"
"Perhaps due to their personalities or their cultural her- itage, these students are more reticent to verbally or socially engage"
The true depth of theirengagement is only recognised when such reserved students elect to speak or put their thoughts on paper
"Consequently, researchers and teachers who focus on observable indi- cators of literacy engagement may misread or misinterpret these students ’involvement in their own literacy development"
"Likewise, researchers who attempt to deconstruct engage- ment into discrete categories may overlook the degree to which the behavioural, cognitive, motivational, emotional and social dimensions of this construct are naturally intertwined"
Is it possible that those regarded as ‘disengaged ’are simply engaged in reading and writing activities that are not part of the traditional or sanctionedcurriculum
"I have been known to argue that, contrary to what others may claim, there is no such thing as an unmotivated student"
"Rather, there are those students who are simply not motivated by what their teachers (or educational researchers) want them to ﬁnd motivat- ing"
Who gets characterised asunengaged may more accurately be students who are unengaged in the academic content or activities typical of formal instruction
"Yet, these students may be actively engaged in reading and writing activities outside of the classroom that do not conform to what isprized by the educational system"
"This has been the consistent message of literacy scholars like Carol Lee (1992), Allan Luke (2003) and Elizabeth Moje (with Ciechanowski, Kramer, Ellis, Carrillo, & Collazo, 2004), who seek to awaken sensitiv-ities toward cultural diversity in reading and writing practices"
"By understanding the lit- erate lives that culturally or ethnically diverse students may lead outside the classroom and by ﬁnding places for those life experiences to be woven into the curriculum, educa- tors may well open the door to these learners ’more willing participation in their own literacy development.ENGAGEMENT AND LITERACY: READING BETWEEN THE LINES 737 © 2018 UKLA"
