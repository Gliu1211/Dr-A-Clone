"TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 2 INTRODUCTION TO THIS TRAINING MANUAL What follows is a manual for instructing secondary or college students in four forms of relational reasoning (RR): analogical, anomalous, antinomous, and antithetical reasoning"
"The training is presented in 6 sessions that includes a pre-assessment (Session I), followed by an overview of RR (Session II), and then multiple sessions devoted to each of the four RR forms (Sessions III–V), ending with a post-assessment of individuals’ RR abilities (Session VI)"
"The manual also contains sample slides that overview the content for each session and specific activities meant to reinforce individuals’ understanding of RR and its specific forms, and to apply that understanding in various ways"
SESSION I: PRE-ASSESSMENT OF RELATIONAL REASONING Students will be given 50 minutes to complete the Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR) online via Qualtrics©
"Once they submit their responses, they will automatically receive their total score and the corresponding Relational Reasoning Quotient (RRQ; see Appendix A), which converts raw scores into standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard de viation of 15"
They will also receive their scores for each scale of the TORR that corresponds to one of the four forms
This pre-assessment can either be completed in person or online such that the learner can progress at their own pace
"For this training, the TORR will be completed outside of class so that there are no time constraints"
Students will be informed that the test needs to be completed in one sitting; there is no stopping and restarting of the test once it is begun.
TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 3 SESSION II: TORR DEBRIEFING AND OVERVIEW OF RELATIONAL REASONING This session begins with an introduction to relational reasoning as a complex cognitive ability that is essential for learning and performance; core to general and domain-specific problem solving; and a key to knowledge transfer (see Session II slides)
"Following this brief explanation of RR, the TORR is overviewed, starting with the rationale for its creation"
"The TORR is contrast to more traditional measures of cognitive ability (intelligence tests) along a number of dimensions, especially noting that the TORR is a fluid versus crystallized measure and the forms are malleable and trainable"
"Then, the descriptive data from the class and discuss what those data indicate about the group’s RR abilities is presented, with emphasis on the importance of the RRQ, which allows for a normative comparison"
Students also reflect on their individual performance relative to the class scores and the normative data
"To overview the TORR, each of the four forms will be briefly introduced: analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis (see the relevant slides for each)"
"Each form is defined and illustrated with a sample item from the TORR, a sample item from the Verbal Test of Relational Reasoning (vTORR), a pictorial or graphic example"
"At the session's end, the class will be informed that they will be receiving explicit training in each of the four forms over the next class sessions to promote their RR abilities."
TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 4 SESSION III: TRAINING IN ANALOGICAL AND ANOMALOUS REASONING Analogies Ask students to recall the definition of analogy from Session II
"Then begin Session III by having students complete the Analogy Anchor Activity with the initial problem, HERD : COW:: FLOCK : ________ (Activity 1)"
"Use those responses to introduce the four key processes to solving analogies and all other forms: encode, infer, map, and apply"
Encode: Is the process whereby each component of a problem is richly characterized
"For example, “herd” is a specific name for a group of animals such as sheep, cows, or goats, and “cow” is a single, female, domesticated, four-legged, milk-producing bovine that provides us with meat, cheese, milk, and hides"
"Infer: Is the process of generating a relation between the first two terms, herd and cow"
Map: The mapping process requires forming a connection between the two parts of the analogy
"Apply: For the final step, the analogy is completed by finding a term that has the same association with flock that cow has to herd AND importantly that is as attributional ly similar to cow as possible"
"So, to complete the analogy, the response must be a member of a flock that is a single, female, domesticated, four-legged, milk-producing animal that provides us with meat, cheese, milk, and hides"
"To reinforce this understanding, students should correct several of their answers on the Analogy Anchor Activity and explain their reasons for the corrections."
"TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 5 Anomaly As with analogy, ask students to recall the meaning of an anomaly"
"Proceed by overviewing how the processes of encoding, inferring, mapping, and applying pertain to anomalies"
Encoding involves richly describing the set of objects that are included in a given set and inferring means determining how each element in the set corresponds to other elements in the set
"Mapping requires the individual to identify specific attributes that differentiate elements in the set (e.g., size, color, category)"
"Finally, wh en applying, the respondent needs to select the object within the set that is aberrant on the most attributes"
"For the fish slide from Session 2, only one large fish was red and swimming in the other direction"
"To reinforce the learning, have students complete the short anomaly activity (see Activity 2)."
"TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 6 SESSION IV: TRAINING IN ANTITHETICAL AND ANTINOMOUS REASONING As an anchor activity for Session IV, have students complete the Anchor Activity, What Comes to Mind"
"Once students have completed the activity, explain that such an exercise demonstrates that humans often think in terms of two conflicting or contrasting ideas"
"The two forms of relational reasoning that the studentsw ill learn about in this session represent such conflicting or contrasting ideas, objects, or events; that is, antithetical reasoning and antinomous reasoning"
"However, these two forms of RR differ from one another in a VERY critical way that often gets ove rlooked"
"As graphically shown in Figure 1, an antinomy represents a binary relation, where the ideas, objects, or events can only belong to one category or the other—with nothing between them"
"For example, in medicine, doctors can certify that someone is alive or dead"
"Figure 1 A Graphic Representation of Antinomy and Antithesis In contrast, an antithesis represents a continuum marked by two polarities or opposites"
"Unlike antinomies, we can identify many other ideas, objects, or events that fall between two endpoints"
"TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 7 Enormous Microscopic Now, see how many words you can position between those two extremes in size"
"In order to test students’ grasp of the difference between antinomy and antithesis, have them go back to Activity 3, What Comes to Mind?"
"Then, allow them time to work in groups to decide whether the answers they produced were examples of antinomous or antithetical reasoning"
"Students should provide justification for their determinations of antimony or antithesis using the process of encode, infer, map, and apply"
"SESSION V: CULMINATING ACTIVITIES Constructing Novel Relational Items For the last training session in relational reasoning, the student will be given the opportunity to create their own items that represent relational reasoning"
This can provide you with another form of assessment along with the TORR where the students assess their understanding of each of the relational forms
"Explain to the students that they should create their own item that they believe assesses for each analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis"
"Let the students know that the examples they create can be spatial with shapes or diagrams, like the ones they we re exposed to in the TORR; pictorial using pictures or much more detailed photos, like the ones they were exposed to during the anomaly and analogy training session; or they can be verbal items, where the learner may write out sentence or mix words together in a list, like the examples they were exposed to during the antinomy and antithesis training."
"TRAINING RELATIONAL REASONING 8 After the students have been given time to create their own example items for each relational form individually, tell them they will now pair up with a peer to share their items"
"Demonstrate for the students how they are to explain the item they created,w hat form of relational reasoning they are attempting to assess for, and the instructions for how their peer should choose what they believe is the right answer to the item question"
"Then, provide the students time to share their items with their peers and work through each novel example"
Bring the students back together for a large group discussion and have them share what their experience was like creating a novel relational reasoning item and attempting to explain it to their peers
"Make sure that as students share their experiences, you continue to refer students back to salient points from prior training sessions"
"In doing so, students will be continuously coached while they are considering specific challenges related to the relational reasoning forms SESSION VI: POST-ASSESSMENT OF RELATIONAL REASONING Students will complete a post-assessment of relational reasoning"
The post-assessment is the same version of the TORR that the students took in the pre-assessment during Session I
"They will be given 50 minutes to complete the TORR online via Qualtrics©.O nce they submit their responses, they will automatically receive their total score and the corresponding RRQ (see Appendix A), as well as their score for each scale of the TORR that corresponds to one of the four forms"
Students are to record those scores in their journals for their comparison to the pre-assessment
This post-assessment can either be completed in person or online such that the learner can progress at their own pace.
