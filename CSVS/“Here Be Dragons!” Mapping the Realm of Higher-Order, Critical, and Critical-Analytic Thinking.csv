SENTENCES
"Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 2 of 18 In many ways, those ancient maps, with their warnings of lurking dangers, are a suitable metaphor for the exploration represented by this special issue"
There is no question that the destination sought by those embarking on this venture rep- resents an admirable end
"A more precise and detailed mapping of higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking, all lauded forms of human thought, is a prize worthy of pursuit"
"Moreover, all contributors to this special issue under- stood that there were no guarantees that they would achieve all they set out to accomplish"
"Over the centuries, many have sought to represent the topography of human thought and to map the boundary between its more or less valued manifes- tations"
"Yet, those prior chartings were incomplete and often confusing; leaving those who navigate the realm that has been variably named higher-order, criti- cal, or critical-analytic thinking without the demarcations required to reach their desired destination"
"For the remainder of this treatise, I will commandeer the phrase valued thinking from Murphy et al"
"So, what would compel the contributors to this special issue to undertake yet another mapping expedition"
What benefits could possibly be reaped from this effort that has not already been realized
Perhaps all that one could hope for when explor- ing human thinking are vague renderings of the separation between less valued from more valued thinking
"On the contrary, I contend that there are good reasons to assume the risks that come with yet another mapping expedition into the realm of valued thinking"
"For one, as the contributors to this spe- cial issue chronicled, existing depictions in the literature, with few exceptions, are insufficient to guide research or instructional practice, with no definitive boundaries between lower and higher or critical and uncritical thinking"
"It was not even evident from the literature surveyed in this special issue whether the areas designated as higher-order, critical, or critical-analytic are truly distinct regions at all, or simply the language preferred by those privileged enough to cre- ate those maps"
Such vague renderings may prove sufficient for many whose edu- cational or psychological research and instructional practices do not require them to venture deep into questions of valued thought
"However, as the editors and contribu- tors to this special issue, our theoretical and empirical work invariably draws us into questions about the nature of valued thinking and about conditions that foster or frustrate such thinking"
"Moreover, as theorists, researchers, and educators, we are often required to judge the depth or shallowness of the thinking we witness in our- selves and others"
"Thus, if we are to recognize, analyze, predict, or facilitate condi- tions that foster depth or richness in thinking, then crude indicators will not suffice"
There are other reasons why those contributing to this special issue have chosen to take up this challenge
"Generally, as the theorists and researchers on this expedi- tion, we collectively acknowledge that better representations of human thought in our domains of expertise have been elusive"
"Nonetheless, I appreciate that our per- spectives on valued thinking also diverge in non-trivial ways"
"As individuals trained in different disciplines and as members of varied research communities, the orienta- tions and traditions we bring to this examination will deviate to some extent"
"Rather than see such deviations as problematic, as editors and contributors, we regard this as a strength"
We felt that through the process of triangulation we would be better
1 3Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 Page 3 of 18 42 able to identify key features of valued thought and be able to recognize areas of con- vergence made more apparent by the places where our ideas diverged
That is pre- cisely why the special issue editors proposed an assemblage of scholars who come to the question of valued thinking from different vantage points
(this issue) approach the question of what counts as valued thinking primarily from the perspective of philosophy
"In so doing, these researchers offer provocative and significant insights into how that “value” has been set over the centuries by a privileged few and what can be done to liberate those determinations"
"Specifically, in this expansive and thought-provoking piece, the authors remind us of the significant contributions of classical philosophers— Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle—and modern-day pragmatists—James, Dewey, and Peirce"
"To the contrary, these authors open our eyes to the way in which power and privilege have silenced certain voices that sought to bring alternative interpretations of what qualifies as valued thinking into the collective consciousness (Kozol, 1991)"
"What also surfaces from those authors’ exploration are clearer distinctions for higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking that hinge largely on the role of justification and what constitutes quality evidence"
Yet another thought-provoking theme in this article pertains to the legacy of behaviorism that has obstructed our view of valued thought
"That legacy centers on the quantification of phenomena that are largely intangible, hidden deep in the recesses of the human mind"
What follows that more philosophical venture is an exploration of thinking criti- cally that traverses the rich literature on strategic processing
"By envisioning valued thinking from this position, Dinsmore and Fryer (this issue) unveil crucial forces that are often overlooked or misrepresented in theoretical and empirical writings on critical thinking and strategic processing"
"For one, these authors remind us that val- ued thinking is reliant on mental engagement that requires intentionality, effort, and monitoring on the part of the thinker"
"In essence, they argue that the attainment of critical thinking cannot be relegated to skills or routinized behaviors that occur auto- matically or rather mindlessly"
"These scholars also acknowledge that there are attributes of individuals that influ- ence whether the mental processes they evoke allow for deep, probing, and trans- formative thoughts to emerge"
"Those attributes include thinkers’ relevant knowledge and experiences, inquisitiveness, comfort with uncertainty, and persistence in the face of challenges"
"While recognizing these important characteristics, Dinsmore and Fryer take great care to distinguish the process of thinking from the thinker per se"
What their exploration also brings to the surface is an important distinction between the process of thinking and its product
"Finally, what Dinsmore and Fryer make apparent is that many tools researchers use to record the processes and assess the products of valued thinking are sadly inadequate and may even misrepresent the phenomenon they seek to portray"
"Within the third contribution, List and Sun (this issue) set a course for valued thinking by way of a particular and complex literacy task, learning from multiple texts"
These authors justify this arena of investigation based on its pervasiveness and the complexity that should be fertile ground for exploring valued thinking
"From their vantage point, the authors looked at this burgeoning literature in a manner not"
Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 4 of 18 previously considered
One key finding they unearthed was actually echoed in other articles in this special issue—the paucity of explicit language to identify the val- ued thinking that was expected from this undertaking
It would seem that research- ers and practitioners may operate under the assumption that valued thinking must naturally arise when certain task conditions are in place; a rather risky assumption it would seem
"List and Sun also describe the disjunction between the processing required during task performance and what is implicated in production after texts have been read, analyzed, and synthesized"
"The authors’ review also raises the criti- cal question of how students are to acquire the knowledge and processing abilities needed to engage multiple texts deeply and to create a product based on the analysis, synthesis, and integration of the content they contain"
(this issue) transports the internal workings of the mind into the external world of the classroom
"Through their systematic review of studies involving project-based or problem-based learning approaches, these authors set out to document how valued forms of thinking can be described, encouraged, supported, and evaluated within instructional programs"
"The initiators of these student-centered approaches (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980; Dewey, 1938) sought to construct environments that would naturally engage learners in val- ued thinking around problems or projects of personal or societal importance"
"Key features that define these approaches include group work, opportunities to build req- uisite background knowledge, consensus building among group members on pro- posed and alternative solutions, and the sharing of findings"
"In general, the outcomes valued within these student-centered programs have been described as critical-think- ing skills and dispositions"
"However, neither of these terms appears to have been well defined by researchers or even explicitly taught (Loyens et al., this issue)"
"Two insights from this review seem especially important to the mapping of higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking"
The first is the discrepancy between what is programmatically assumed and what is actually manifested
The second is the place of dispositions within the realm of valued thinking—concerns that echo the findings of Dinsmore and Fryer (this issue)
I will return to these issues in the final section of this article
"Positioning Higher‑Order, Critical, and Critical‑Analytic Thinking The primary goal of this special issue was to investigate three terms that signify mental engagement prized over more reactive, intuitive, or pedestrian forms of human thought: higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking"
The hope was that this journey through less charted waters would lead to a more precise mapping of valued thinking that can aid others seeking to navigate this realm
"In setting out on this expedition, I was not ignorant of the perils that others have faced"
"Decades ago, Larry Cuban, an educational prognosticator, warned: “Defining thinking skills, reasoning, critical thought and problem solving is troublesome to both social sci- entists and practitioners"
"Troublesome is a polite word; the area is a conceptual swamp” (1984,p"
"Nonetheless, I have chosen to push forward into this con- ceptual (and methodological) morass, guided by the work and insights of the four"
1 3Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 Page 5 of 18 42 contributors to this special issue
To do otherwise would be to leave future travelers without any data garnered from this expedition
"One of the controversial questions that guided this special issue was whether there are truly meaningful distinctions to be drawn among the often-used terms for valued thinking—higher order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking—or not"
"I acknowledge that the labels, higher-order thinking and critical thinking, have a life that extends beyond contemporary theory and empirical inquiry"
"In contrast, critical-analytic thinking is a more recent descriptor appearing less in the research literature or common discourse (Alexander, 2014)"
"Popularity and recency aside, however, all three terms signify some manner of mental activity regarded as worthwhile and necessary for dealing with complex, non-routine problems, and they have been associated with enhanced or improved performance (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Grossnickle Peterson et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2018)"
"This commonality aside, the answer that I would now forward to the question of whether there are meaningful differences in what these three terms signify about human thinking is “yes.” In the ensuing section, I justify that response based on evidence proffered by the contents of this special issue and on characterizations those contributions engendered"
I initially delve into each form of valued thinking separately and then draw meaningful comparisons among them in Table 1
"Higher‑Order Thinking: Breadth Versus Depth In my 40+ years of research, I have divined a particularly salient pattern when it comes to the conceptualization of social science constructs: The more commonplace and widespread the use of a specific term, the less likely that term will be well and consistently conceptualized"
That seems to be the fate of the construct of higher- order thinking
"Of the terms addressed in this special issue, “higher-order” is argu- ably the most commonly used label for human thought that departs from intuitive, impulsive, or non-contemplative mental functioning (Lewis & Smith, 1993)"
The very descriptor higher is meant to signify a boundary of sorts between this more prized manner of thinking and less valued forms
"Nonetheless, as the use of the relative implies, there is no definitive line between which manifestations of human thinking can unequivocally be identified as “higher” or “lower.” Even the developers of the taxonomy for the cognitive domain, which remains the most cited source of evidence for the designation “higher-order” (Bloom et al., 1956), recognized that the problem of appropriate ordering had “probably not been solved completely satisfactorily” (p"
"(2001) set out to improve upon Bloom et al.’s (1956) original taxonomy, they sought to expand and reconfigure the processes encompassed in the original, while retaining “the princi- ple of increasing complexity” central to the taxonomy (Anderson, 1999,p"
"They made that decision based, in part, on the manner in which the cognitive processes varied as a result of contextual and domain-specific factors—although the revised taxonomy remains heavily generic in form."
"Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 6 of 18Table 1 Characterization and comparison of higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking Form Principal sources Philosophical/psychological orientationsKey features Primary strengths Major limitations Practical implications Empirical considera- tions Higher order thinkingBloom et al"
Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 8 of 18 Another reason why I have positioned “higher-order” to the periphery of the realm of valued thinking relates to the purpose for the generation of its taxonomic designation
"Bloom and committee members, who were predominantly college examiners from leading American universities, devised the taxonomy for the pur- pose of providing guidance in the writing of educational objectives, the construction of assessments, and the development of curricular documents"
"Further, those pur- poses were cast in the language of behavioral objectives"
That fact helps to explain why knowledge was positioned as it was in the taxonomy
"conceived of knowledge as simple facts that could be memorized, regurgitated, and thus objectively assessed"
"Conversely, “evaluation” was viewed as the most complex of the six cognitive behaviors"
Yet Bloom and the committee were aware of the potential problems in this ordering
"As they wrote: For the most part, the evaluations customarily made by an individual are quick decisions not preceded by very careful consideration of the various aspects of the object, idea, or activity being judged"
"Customarily, opinions are made at less than a fully con- scious level and the individual may not be fully aware of the clues or bases on which he is forming his appraisals"
"For purposes of classification, only those evaluations which are or can be made with distinct criteria in mind are considered"
Such evalu- ations are highly conscious and ordinarily are based on a relatively adequate com- prehension and analysis of the phenomena to be appraised
It is recognized that this may be far from the normal state of affairs
"It is, however, based on a recognition that educational procedures are intended to develop the more desirable rather than the more customary types of behavior"
"186) [my emphasis] Regrettably, the need for students to provide substantiation for the decisions or judgments they reached was not a specific requirement of these evaluations"
"Without this specification, it is possible for “evaluations” to take the form of non-reflective opinions rather than reasoned judgments (Lombardi et al., 2016)"
This remains a continuing problem in the mapping of valued thinking as I will illustrate in the ensu- ing discussion of critical thinking
Critical Thinking: Journeying Deeper into Valued Thought Compared to higher order thinking à la Bloom et al
"(1956), critical thinking, as characterized by those who identified with the Critical Thinking Movement of the 1980s, progressed deeper into the realm of valued thinking"
"As I will endeavor to show, critical thinking brings travelers closer to locating valued thinking over higher-order thinking, although serious limitations remain (see Table 1)"
"As Bloom et al.’s taxonomy served as the gateway into higher-order thinking, “Critical Think- ing: A Statement of Expert Consensus for Purposes of Educational Assessment and Instruction: Research Findings and Recommendations” (Facione, 1990) became a landmark document for critical thinking"
"Better known as the Delphi report, for the consensus building method the committee employed, this work was sponsored by the American Philosophical Association"
"1 3Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 Page 9 of 18 42 in the construction of the report, but they were joined by psychologists, educators, and assessment experts"
"Not only was there less of a behavioristic overtone in this report but also more consideration of messier, less structured societal issues along- side"
This conceptualization of critical thinking also differed from higher-order thinking in the emphasis placed on instructional approaches rather than instruc- tional objectives
This focus was quite evident in the review of project-based and problem-based programs by Loyens et al
"(1956), this consensus building resulted in a list of six cognitive processes that the committee (erroneously in my judgment) labeled skills or abilities (i.e., interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation) along with related subskills"
"“Inference,” for example, was said to encompass the ability… to identify and secure elements needed to draw reasonable conclusions; to form conjectures and hypotheses; to consider relevant information and to educe the con- sequences flowing from data, statements, principles, evidence, judgments, beliefs, opinions, concepts, descriptions, questions, or other forms of representation"
"16) Presented in similar detail, inferences subskills were querying evidence, conjec- turing alternatives, and drawing conclusions"
This particular example illustrates that the conceptualization of these six skills extends well beyond the typical meaning conveyed in the psychological and educational literature
"For instance, in the text- processing literature, an inference can refer to the ability to extrapolate meaning that is not expressly stated but is implied within a text (McNamara, 2021)"
It would seem that conceptualizations of these cognitive activities within the Delphi report are more rooted in philosophy than psychology or education
"The same contention is true of the skill “explanation.” In the Delphi report, the delineation of explanation is more elaborate than the commonplace notion of giv- ing an accounting, detailing, or providing clarifying information"
"Explanation was described as the ability… to state the results of one’s reasoning; to justify that reasoning in terms of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological and contextual considerations upon which one’s results were based; and to present one’s reasoning in the form of cogent arguments"
18) This specificity and purposes ascribed to critical thinking by Facione and others move it closer to the ideal of valued thinking
"Nonetheless, the non-trivial concerns swirling around this conceptualization and operationalization of critical thinking indicate there is still some distance to go before the epitome of valued thinking is reached"
One area of concern pertains to efforts to delineate dispositions that mark one as a critical thinker
"In effect, this literature not only centered on the what of critical thinking but also the who"
"Yet, the more significant limitation within the critical thinking literature remains the absence of any definitive boundary that indicates that this desired destination of valued thinking has been reached"
"In effect, there were so many suggested char- acteristics of critical thinking within the Delphi report (1990), but no clarity as to"
Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 10 of 18 which of the myriad of characteristics were held to be necessary and sufficient for the mental activity to attain the status of valued thinking
Does any one of the listed skills qualify the act as critical thinking
Or is it assumed that the ideal state of criti- cal thinking requires the manifestation of all these skills and subskills
"Indeed, the committee purposefully referred to the collection of skills and subskills as a “list” to avoid any sense of ordering or hierarchy"
"While that is all well and good from the standpoint of a theoretical discussion, it fails to establish the line between what ulti- mately qualifies as valued thinking and what does not"
"Critical‑Analytic Thinking and the Necessity of Evidence‑Based Justifications A decade ago, 18 multidisciplinary scholars gathered together to delve into ques- tions about what it means to think critically and analytically and what is required to foster this form of valued thinking in children, youth, and adults"
"This gathering was sponsored by American Educational Research Association’s Education Research Interdisciplinary Conferences Program (Alexander et al., 2013)"
"As with the Del- phi report, this conference aimed to seek common ground or consilience (Whewell, 1840; Wilson, 1998) among the attendees whose varied disciplines included edu- cational policy and leadership, cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, language and literacy, social psychology, individual differences, measurement and assessment, and educational psychology"
There was agreement among the partici- pating scholars that the ideas about higher-order and critical thinking were vague and underspecified
"Further, efforts to promote deep reflective thinking and deci- sion-making that was evidence-based and adequately justified were often unsuccess- ful or their influence was limited"
"(1999b) so eloquently argued: As soon as [theorists] begin to spell out in more concrete terms what critical thinking consists in, what educational attainments are required if one is to be a criti- cal thinker, and what means are likely to be efficacious in teaching persons to think critically, that is to say, as soon as they interpret the term in such a way as to provide a clear conception of critical thinking, agreement evaporates"
"285) As an alternative to the more familiar terms of higher-order and critical think- ing, the participants in the Interdisciplinary Conference chose to use the language of critical-analytic thinking for several reasons"
"For one, they wanted to avoid what- ever preconceptions about higher-order or critical-thinking participants might bring to the discussions"
"There was also a growing philosophical and psychological lit- erature that endowed critical-analytic thinking with a salient attribute that seemed absent from the existing literature, more determinative criteria for what does or does not qualify as valued thinking (Haack, 1993; Murphy, 2007; Quine, 1969; Wade et al., 1994)"
"By wedding critical thinking and analytic reasoning, an individual or group can achieve “an examined understanding of something known or believed (see Table 1)"
"This examination is characterized by a systematic evaluation of the object of thought and claims, reasons, and evidence forwarded about that object” (Murphy et al., 2014,p"
"Moreover, the evidence and justification needed to support that evaluation must be well-matched to the nature of the problem at hand"
"1 3Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 Page 11 of 18 42 For example, someone who comes to believe on the basis of poor or irrelevant reasons, on the authority of someone whose credibility is questionable, or without attempting to assess the evidence relevant to the truth of the belief, would not usu- ally be regarded as thinking critically"
This suggests that thinking about what to believe or do must meet appropriate standards if it is to be regarded as critical think- ing
"If someone were inadvertently to fulfil relevant standards in their thinking, but had not intentionally attempted to fulfil them, they would not generally be regarded as having engaged in critical thinking"
To be engaged in critical thinking one must be aware that there are such standards and must be striving to fulfil them
"(1999a, 1999b) refer must be understood in relation to the characteristics of the problem or issue to be analyzed, such as its complexity, as well as the sociocultural context or situation in which it is encountered"
"Alexander and colleagues called this epistemic competence (Alexander et al., 2011; Grossnickle Peterson et al., 2017)"
"Specifically, epistemic competence can be defined as “the use of available contextual elements to determine the sources of evidence best suited for a given problem in an effort to provide an answer that is justified true belief” (Grossnickle Peterson et al., 2017,p"
"Thus, those who apply the same evidentiary standards to varied problems would seem as misguided as those who offer no standards at all when justifying their views or judgments"
"(this issue) strongly contend, establishing those standards can- not be the purview of a privileged few but must welcome the wisdom and experi- ences of all, most notably minoritized groups whose perspectives and histories have been overlooked for far too long"
"Perils on the Journey to Valued Thinking With these distinctions among higher-order, critical, and critical-analytic thinking mapped out, I offer several warnings to others who wish to navigate the realm of valued thinking"
"Specifically, I want to warn individuals about the need to plot the conceptual course they are pursuing, push beyond reflection into deeper waters, look for signs of intentionality and effort, and stay focused on the journey"
"Navigating Valued Thinking Demands Specification I remember watching my late brother Robert, a navigator in the Air Force, chart and rechart his course before ever taking to the air"
It was evident to him that being precise about one’s destination and the path to follow was a critical first step in any journey
That is undoubtedly good advice for anyone who seeks to study valued thinking or to guide others to that port of call
"Yet the articles in this special issue were a painful reminder that educational researchers and practitioners are far more likely to set off with little more than a vague sense of where they are going, what"
"Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 12 of 18 is required to get there, and how to know if they have indeed arrived at the desired locale"
"For more than 30 years, my colleagues and I have been decrying the lack of clarity and specificity in the definitions of constructs that educational research- ers and practitioners hold dear (Alexander et al., 1991; Alexander et al., 2009; Din- smore et al., 2008; Murphy & Alexander, 2000)"
It would seem from this special issue that those cries have largely fallen on deaf ears
"Let me be clear, however, that I am not calling for a consensus definition of val- ued thinking"
"Those who have devoted themselves to such endeavor (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956; Facione, 1990) can certainly attest to the herculean effort required to come even close to that goal"
"Rather, all I am asking is that researchers investigating some manner of valued thinking or those trying to educe valued think- ing in others begin by being explicit and sufficiently detailed in what they hold those ideas to mean"
They should also work toward means and measures that clearly and appropriately reflect the conceptions they forward
I do not regard these preparatory steps as too much to ask of researchers or practitioners
"Valued Thinking Requires More than Reflection One point of consensus among the contributors to this volume, as well as most researchers who delve into valued thinking, is that John Dewey’s (1910) writings on reflection are foundational"
"As with Dewey (1910) and James (1890), I regard reflec- tion as necessary for any form of thinking that moves beyond ordinary, habituated, or reactive mental activity to arise"
"This demarcation between reflection and reac- tion parallels contemporary theory and research on Type 1 versus Type 2 (Stanovich & Toplak, 2012) or System 1 versus System 2 thinking (Kahneman, 2011)"
"How- ever, while passage into reflective thought leaves behind the more pedestrian, lower- order forms of human cogitation, there is still a great distance to progress before the ideal of valued thinking is reached"
"Moreover, while I recognize the reflection as the sine qua non of valued thinking, there are still hazards awaiting on the journey"
"For instance, those who have recently spent time in classrooms, either as teachers or as students, can likely attest to the fact that time for reflection is often in short supply (Hmelo-Silver, 2004)"
"Teachers are taxed to cover the content (Schmidt et al., 2011), while students set their sights on getting their assigned tasks over and done as soon as possible (Alexander, 2018)"
"Also, today’s students who are members of the iGen- eration often spend more time with their minds turned outward to the digital world than inward and engaged in thoughtful and mindful reflection (Rosen et al., 2013)"
"As discussed in this special issue, there are approaches like project-based or problem-based learning (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Dahlgren & Dahlgren, 2002) and Quality Talk (Murphy et al., 2018) that emphasize reflection as part of a systematic instructional model"
"However, the successful implementation of these instructional models is predicated on more than reflection, as Lombardi (this issue) discusses in the overview of this special issue"
"Their developers recognized that valued think- ing requires much more, such as a base of relevant knowledge about the topic or"
"1 3Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 Page 13 of 18 42 problem at hand; strategies for gathering relevant information and for probing, ana- lyzing, and synthesizing that information; and the opportunity to share their ques- tions, hypotheses, and findings with others (Lombardi et al., 2013; Lombardi et al., 2021)"
"Regrettably, it would seem that some researchers who claim to be using such student-centered approaches or programs have failed to demonstrate that these essential components have actually been implemented (Loyens et al., this issue)"
"Without Intentionality and Effort, Valued Thinking Cannot Be Realized Within the educational psychology literature, there has been a concerted effort to alert researchers and practitioners to crucial distinctions between skills and strate- gies (Afflerbach et al., 2008; Alexander, 2006; Dinsmore, 2018; Harris et al., 2008)"
"These distinctions, which include intentionality and effort, were well overviewed by Dinsmore and Fryer (this issue)"
"Being among those who share this mission (Alexan- der et al., 1998), I was dismayed to find the repeated labeling of processes associated with higher-order or critical thinking as skills (Bloom et al., 1956; Facione, 1990)"
"In essence, while I hold the notion of “habits of mind” (James, 1890) as core to my conceptualization of valued thinking, I would not equate habits of mind to habitu- ated thinking"
"I appreciated Bailin et al.’s (1999a) reminder that the word “skill” has variable meanings within the philosophical, psychological, and educational literature"
"Nonetheless, for me and others, that term conveys a sense that the processes in ques- tion have been honed through repeated practice to the point of habituation or automa- ticity (Alexander, 2006; Bailin et al., 1999a; Dinsmore & Fryer, this issue)"
"Thus, the use of the word “skills” in the key writings on higher-order thinking and critical thinking strikes me as antithetical, even paradoxical, to what is required to reach valued thinking"
"As Resnick and National Research Council (1987) noted, the mental actions aligned with valued thinking are “nonalgorithmic, complex, effort- ful, and involve the application of multiple criteria, uncertainty (regarding the solu- tion path to the problem), and self-regulation of the thinking process” (p"
"Essentially, one cannot operate on autopilot and be within the realm of valued thinking"
"The problem or task at hand must be thoughtfully analyzed and appropriate strategies must be intention- ally chosen, their effectiveness monitored, and changes instituted as warranted"
"(1999a) succinctly argued this point by stating that “all aspects of critical think- ing centrally involve judgment, and judgment cannot be made routine” (p"
"In effect, without intentionality and effort, valued thinking, as described by Murphy et al"
"The Focus Should Be on Valued Thinking and Not on the Valued Thinker Another label attached to critical thinking in the literature overviewed within this special issue was dispositions (Dinsmore & Fryer, this issue; Loyens et al., this issue)"
"The subject of dispositions was most evident in the Delphi report (Facione, 1990)"
"Although never explicitly defined in the report, the authors wrote of disposi- tions in their consensus statement:"
"Educational Psychology Review (2023) 35:42 1 3 42 Page 14 of 18 The ideal critical thinker is habitually inquisitive, well-informed, trustful of rea- son, open-minded, flexible, fair-minded in evaluation, honest in facing personal biases, prudent in making judgments, willing to reconsider, clear about issues, orderly in complex matters, diligent in seeking relevant information, reasonable in the selection of criteria, focused in inquiry, and persistent in seeking results which are as precise as the subject and the circumstances of inquiry permit"
It combines developing CT skills with nurturing those dispositions [which] consistently yield useful insights and [which] are the basis of a rational and democratic society
3) There was apparently controversy over the inclusion of dispositions in the final Delphi report
"A substantial minority of the experts (30%) insisted that the term critical thinking be used “in a strict procedural sense, that is as referring only to a certain judgmental process"
They [the dissenting 30%] distinguish sharply between what is true of critical thinking from what is true of good critical thinkers” (p
"Indeed, I and others (Bailin et al., 1999b; Dinsmore & Fryer, this issue; Lom- bardi, this issue; Schutz et al., 2020) would have signed on to that minority report"
"To be clear, I acknowledge that individual differences or personality traits are influential in any human endeavor"
You cannot subtract the person from the equa- tion and still validly represent the phenomenon of valued thinking
"Moreover, not only are people cognitively, socially, motivational, and emotionally unique, but also they function in social, historical, and cultural contexts that call for valued thinking"
"Thus, it is indefensible to assume that individuals, regardless of their positive dispo- sitional characteristics, are willing and able to think critically and analytically in the manner and to the level required for the mental tasks they undertake"
"My colleague, Paul Schutz, recently framed this conundrum provocatively when he wrote (personal communication, July 11, 2020): Situationally, critical thinking is about a particular problem within a particular social historical context…Which begs the question, can someone who has been labeled a “crit- ical thinker” not actually think critically in certain situations"
"(1999a) forwarded a similar argument about the misleading connota- tion of “critical thinker” as a rather stable characterization: To a considerable extent, the quality of thinking persons are able to do about a par- ticular problem, issue or question is determined by what they know, or are able to find out, about it and about the context in which it must be resolved"
"Moreover, critical think- ing always takes place in the context of (and against the backdrop of) already existing concepts, beliefs, values, and ways of acting"
This context plays a very significant role in determining what will count as sensible or reasonable application of standards and prin- ciples of good thinking
"Thus, the depth of knowledge, understanding and experience persons have in a particular area of study or practice is a significant determinant of the degree to which they are capable of thinking critically in that area"
290) I would add one more provocation to this cautionary tale of operating from the perspective of critical thinker versus critical thinking
"Reasoning antinomously, for a moment, let us assume that it is possible to categorize individuals as critical thinkers or, in Facione’s (1990) words, to identify those who habitually manifest the charac- teristics of the ideal critical thinker"
